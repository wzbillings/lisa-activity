The Mean Admin says BLM
Not voting / voting third party is just a vote for Trump.
Let's be real no one likes Biden, but when it's a choice between a facist dictator who will probably start the next genocide...
I.e - locking immigrants and children in cages
- for more police control / ICE
- against BLM
- " stand back and stand by Proud Boys"
- pro white supremacisy
And a man who is not all those things, I'd rather pick the man who is not all those things.
But if you're someone who doesn't have to worry about the things posted above, you are privileged. And hey, as a straight cis white woman, I didn't worry about that kind of stuff for years either. I come from a place of privilege and I made the mistake of voting third party in the 2016 election.
It's something I regret with all my heart, so please, be kind, think of others, and vote Biden 2020
Thanks for coming to my Ted talk

I miss the summer of 2018

I was going out to LA to hang out with my friends almost every other week
And I didn't pay for my own gas back then
Sighs
I was with my current man
I was gonna go to an actual university in the fall
I didn't have a job cause Toys - R - Us shut down but I still had HELLA money saved up
So I could have fun with no worries
Mmm
that was my last REAL summer

When people ask questions about the book club , I know they didn't actually read anything
" How do you join"
Look at the forms chapter

Look to the forms chapter
" How does this work"
Look to the rules chapter

This implies to real life as well but

has been losing hearts but https://www.quotev.com/story/12388516/Finding-My-Space-A-Book-of-Poetry/1
has been gaining them
Idk it's weird to watch
can't wait where I'm free enough to be able to advertise again
and to release my NOVEL that I'm working on :)
Almost to page 50

I fucking hate when people make comments about chapter length and expect it to be valid critique.
It doesn't matter how long a chapter is don't be stupid
A chapter should end where the cut off feels natural.
If you don't believe me look at Dan Brown
He's a famous author and most of his chapters are less than a page long.
But anyway
COMMENTING ABOUT CHAPTER LENGTH IS POINTLESS DON'T DO IT

So we made our decision for the Pokémon Contest announcer
And we're pleased to say that it is:
All of you!
To keep it interesting, we have decided to have all of you as announcers, which will switch off each contest.
But, here's another fun aspect:
If you're not the announcer, you will be the judge! So you can always be apart of the topic. The third judge will be one of the admins.
Now, as far as putting the contest together, what do you guys think the best way to make this contest the best for an rp setting?
We're gonna let you guys help decide because it will be you running the show. So we are welcomed to most ideas!

I hate when people say "Well, if they don't like how they're being treated there, maybe they should just find another job"
Like it's so easy to find another full time job that pays at least 40,000 a year and gives you (some) benefits.
When you don't have a degree because you didn't have the chance to go to college because you had to help supplying the family.
People who say "Just find another job" come from a place of privilege and don't understand just how hard it is to live out in the real world.
Help support what's right, spread information, and come help if you want tarnish this company's name.

Wild thing happened today
Made my boyfriend come with me to get gas cause it was 2am and I am a woman.
So there's this weird guy walking down the street. Like he's walking like a zombie, it was probably just some disabled homeless guy
Anyway, at the crosswalk, there's also a woman up ahead, so they cross the street and you can tell she quickens her pace cause she's freaked out by the guy.
And then he starts to follow her. Like up to the 7/11 and I'm staying because I'm concerned for her but she even Made a swift turn towards me and my boyfriend and she's talking to herself under her breath, probably scared
And my boyfriend keeps nagging me to get into the car
So I do.
But like,
He deadass didn't notice she was being followed by this guy
He told me " I just noticed two people being weird"
Like fjeiejfjjdkdkekdjjekdkskdkrkdkfj

1) He Ugly
2) his backstory isn't that sad. In fact, its high-key common so it should be more frustrating to viewers that we continue to treat children like that
3) He really has no redemption what-so-ever. And what did happen came from fucking no-where. His character development was rushed and sloppy.
4) He tries to get with married women
5) DID SEASON TWO NOT HAPPEN FOR YOU GUYS? He's just a dick
6) Sexualizes women, see's women for pretty much only sex
7) is just a fuckboi with no redeeming qualities
Edit: 8) I would vote him most likely to shoot up a school
Edit 9) He threatens kids, tried running over them, threatens his own sister
Edit 10) Is just a bully in general
Edit 11) He's racist

I have called you here because I want your advise, suggestions, and feedback on a couple of things.
The first thing is: How do we get more people to rp and battle with gym leaders? We have the people, but don't seem very interested in rping with you guys. I was wondering if you guys had any situations to maybe make the gym battles more appealing.

The second thing is:
How do you think we can get the gym leaders more active and involved in the main rp?
Because not only can you guys rp in the main rp as the gym leader, but also your characters can also be in the events, like the one starting up soon.
I just want your thoughts and opinions

Y'all I made a Christmas playlist like two years ago for my mom cause she HATED Pandora for music
Cause she just likes what she's listen to for decades
So I made her one and she LOVES IT
it's all she listens to during Christmas and honestly it's my greatest achievement

where face to face with how it ends
When everday we wpent together melts away
I just want to stay
but lazy afternoons we sat together looking at the sky
Say goodbye
without a regret...
Even though they can't recall
I will always know that taste of ice cream
Just us four
that's really how I always hoped it'd be
But things are never as they seem
Without a doubt I pray we all can meet again
in an ideal end

I yeah I watched the new show my Matt Groening
The one on Netflix
It was pretty funny uh
Honest opinion
Some of the characters were really hard to like which made the show drag on, and you have to get past the first episode because the first is very rushed and jumps all over the place.
But honestly the humor is great
Instead of mainly relying on butt and fart and penis jokes
It relies on more timed jokes and shit like that
I recommend it
More so if you're a fan of Futurama. It's not as good as it, but it gets better as the show goes on

Me reading the reviews for my favorite movie on Amazon:
The one star reviews: it boring, couldn't make it through the first hour
I thought it was going to be a lovey dovey film!!
The five star reviews: this is a work of art honestly let me go into the film's dynamic issue....
This reminds me of the story Fahrenheit 451 in the sense that it destroys the idea of free thought and....
So what I gained from this is
If you a simple bitch who doesn't like anything special or unique in a movie

To all my older friends out here remember if you go out drinking today for this
Glorious may 5th
Just remember the real history behind the holiday in which a small portion of Mexico was able to stop the French from helping the south during the American Civil War and basically helped stop the south from winning
It is not Mexico's independence day and I've heard most of Mexico doesn't even celebrate it
So before you put on sombreros and drink tequila remember that they're real people with a real culture and it's not your culture to wear and make fun of

The CGI was good, acting was good, kid was cute
Could have done without the songs but the two singing was cute

A lot better than the original

Apprently still living with her ex boyfriend and his mom ( so you know her and her ex are still fucking )
She's 28 (he's 22) and honestly when you look at her you just get a bad vibe off of her

Okay so I saw the The Greatest Showman tonight and this is my two cents
It has been seven hours since I have seen it and honestly I don't remember what happened. And this says a lot from someone who loves full blown musicals.
The music was actually really good. A little too poppy, but still good. It was catchy. What the movie had going for it was the music, the cinematography , and the dancing oml it was great. It was great to watch. It's fun and there's so much to look at
But
Aha
You won't give a single shit about any of the characters. None of them have backstory, and you are given no reason to like any of them. The main character is kinda an asshole, not even the " freaks" have anything expect that they're the underdogs. I did get bored when watching the movie and was thinking of leaving halfway through this two hour of pointless dialogue, with way to quick pacing and too little time to truly enjoy the bright and colorful settings that the movie sets up. Honestly the cinematography was the only thing

Hi my name's Lisa and I have such little faith in humanity that I sometimes cry during Christmas songs because the fact that we turned a season that usually symbolizes death, decay, and cold into something warm, loving, and giving and if you don't think that's beautiful I don't know what is

Stereotypes I've noticed while working in retail
White people are the loudest
Female white people with blonde hair ask for the fucking manager
Hispanic always pay in cash
Hispanic mothers are always so sweet (to me at least )
Indians (actual Indians from India for those not living in 2017) are always so super slow when they check out. Like MY FUCKING GOD THERE IS A LINE BEHIND YOU.
Teenagers in high school tend to be really nice and sweet
Middle schoolers are the spawn of Satan. More so males but females in large groups too.
Hispanic mothers are queens. Power to them. 👌👌
White people don't know how to control their FUCKING KIDS
Asians always ask if we have coupons behind the counter?? The answer is no we ain't hiding them ??

"Wow, you act a lot older than you are. "
It gets depressing to hear after a while

It's just so unfair
All she does is have fun and does nothing
Goes to theme parks
Draw all day in her room
Just gets to fucking relax
And I maybe get a day off maybe once a month to do nothing
And even then it's not even a day off
I most likely requested a day off for a reason.
I just never get a break

It just really pisses me off that my parents or really no one gets how busy I am.
My dad was just
Shocked that I had no time to go to Six Flags with him and the family.
They planned a date ( without FUCKING TELLING ME)
And they planned it four days in advanced and were just shocked a couldn't come.
Like do you not fucking remember I've been working every Friday for the past THREE YEARS
or everyday of the weekend
I got to school four days a week then work the other three and they just don't get how busy I am??? It just makes me so mad to the point of tears.
The fact I can only see my boyfriend one day a week should say something
Or just the fact I'm never fucking home.
And then my fucking freeloading sister. No job, no longer going to school gets mad when I don't do chores? Like bitch what are you doing with that day, compare it to mine and let's see who has the time to get on their knees and scrub the bathtub. Yeah it's probably not the person who's fucking doing homework and has work in two hours.

He took it back and took another long hit before coughing a little bit. Right, it had been a little while since had last done this. "Look at you, being all rebellious. Proud of you kid. I was about your age when I took my first hit, so, seems only fitting. " He stated in amusement, putting the pen done so Zexion could take it again if he wanted too. This was Xigbar's way of giving the kid a normal childhood. Ironically enough. Sure, he's a teenager but whatever, this was apart of being a teenager, being a little bit rebellious and having fun.. .It's not about work.

Xigbar smiled at that response. "You're a good kid, Zexion. That's what I like to hear. " He then paused, as if he remembered something as he pulled out a small pen like thing. "let me see if I still got-" he opened it up to reveal he's a douchebag and he has an e-cigarette. "don't have much left, but it's strong shit" he stated. He clicked it a few times to turn it on and took a long inhale before blowing out some smoke. It smelled like weed. "be careful. It is really strong" he stated and handed it over to Zexion. " All you do is press the button, wait a second, then breathe it in. "

"Just remember one thing kiddo, when it comes to drinking. You can drink to wash away the stress, don't drink to wash away the emotions, alright?" He told the other sternly, tossing a chip at him.

A smirked moved across Xigbars face as he said that. "Hey, what can I say. You were going to do it anyway. I know how sneaky you are, but not sneaky enough when I caught trying to steal one of my bottles of rum" he shook his head. "Still gotta work with that kiddo. Or you know... Just ask.

Xigbar watched him for a moment as silence fell over them. He paused, and debated what he wanted to say. He could tell there was something, but he also didn't want to nag the kid too much. He placed a hand on Zexions shoulder before asking " you sure there's nothing bothering you kiddo? " He asked, deciding he would try once, and anything past that it was clear that Zexion most likely wouldn't want to be bothered with it

He raised an eyebrow at that. "Even if I'm busy beyond belief. I at least try to see Demyx once a day if I can. Even if it's just a quick kiss on the cheek before running off. I may be a douchebag but I'm also an asshole, but I'm not a cunt" he stated with a bit of a chuckle. "Just be careful around him, I don't trust him and if he ever does anything to hurt you...

"Work... Mostly Work" Xigbar replied as he thought it over in his head. He jokes about smoking but he hadn't done it in a while, he's been too busy to do any of that. "Demyx and I finally got together and that's been going well. I feel bad because I can't give him as much time as he needs, but... Work is work " He shrugged a bit as he gave up on making food and just pulled out chips and salsa instead, placing them at the table as he began to munch at them. "What about you? How's you and flower boy?"

Xigbar was about to raise an eyebrow at how well Zexion was downing the alcohol, but it only turned into a grin as he nodded. He learned from the best, and Xigbar was proud. "Alright kiddo, I'll be here" He stated, taking the bottle before taking another swig of it. Eh, perhaps he could make some food as well. If he still had some weed he would be down for making nachos or something... Who was he kidding nachos were always good he's making nachos.

He took the pen and very carefully, wrote what was written underneath the messy notes in a very clean handwriting. He had nice handwriting when he tried. "Truth is" the nobody began, working quickly but carefully. "Demyx's handwriting is worse than this and part of my job is reading the reports" He stated, taking a few more moments to finish up before closing up everything and handing it back over to the much younger nobody. "Anything else you need help with kiddo?"

He chuckled and looked back to the other "Any excuse to get crossfaded sounds like a good idea to me" He stated before beginning to read through the sloppy, messy notes. He fell a bit silent as he concentrated on reading everything with his one eye, falling silent for a few minutes before reaching out his hand to the other. "You got a pen?" He asked, assuming that the scientist would have one on him.

He glanced to the other as they made it to the kitchen, Xigbar instantly going to the top shelf and pulling down some dark rum right off the back, instantly filling up his flask. "Yeah, I'll take a gander, can't be an worse than your writing when you were eight" He joked before passing the bottle over to Zexion, however, not before taking a swig straight from the bottle. "And I doubt it's nothing. Some of my best ideas came when I was crossfaded as all hell. Xemnas called me a genius and then proceeded to bitch slap me when he caught the smell.

The older nobody couldn't help but raise an eyebrow at that. "I didn't make you an alcoholic, did I?" He asked, regarding the fact that he used to sneak Zexion drinks when he was a teenager. None the less, he nodded and gestured for the other to follow him as he continued to make his way down the hallway. "I mean, I started when I was your age but... Life is meaningless and pointless so I can't really blame you either." He laughed at that and kept walking.

"Besides, it's been a while since I've talked to you, let alone seen you. If Mansex is keeping you too busy, let me know, I can probably convince him to cut you and your old man some slack, yeah?"

Now, Xigbar wasn't a fool, he knew the scientist was one to get lost in his thoughts and move around as such. So, he just being curious to see if Zexion would notice Xigbar standing his path... and it turns out he didn't, how amusing. Xigbar looked down to the younger scientist, a bit of a neutral expression on his face as he asked "Are you alright there, kiddo? You look more zoned out than usual" He stated, half joking, half serious. Well, he did care the kid, after all he watched him grow up since he was but a child, you get a soft spot for that kind of stuff, even if he wouldn't admit it.

My art teacher was like
"In the 1800s women couldn't be artist, doesn't that upset you ladies ? " And when no one replied she was like "what, is that normal? Are you not bothered "
And I was like " it was in the past, there's nothing we can do about it now "
And she didn't respond and kept teaching but like
Yo
Why be upset with history when you can just learn from it yo.
I love history because of the wisdom gained from it, not from the stories you hear. It's the same reason I love reading.

Xigbar snorted a bit when she asked that. "Pft, as if. He'd beat my ass I said that in front of him, but he ain't here, is he?" He stated with a chuckle before continuing to peer out. He's been in this castle long enough to discover this kind of stuff. Besides, it's a castle, it has to have some secrets. He focused on the view, smiling a bit as he did so. This always calmed him down after a stressful day.

If you want to try to bring back the friendship, go for it, if you want to cut him out of your life, go for it.

Yeah, Xigbar, what are you doing here? He didn't need to be here, he could be with the cutie pie Demyx or he could be drinking or something more worth his time than... This. Talking to a puppet with sleeping issues.
"Hell, is it a crime to check on you?" he asked, sounding a bit annoyed with her tone.

At the words he turned around and looked to the approaching figure. "Hell if I know. I placed him down on a couch and left some potions for him. He could be anywhere honestly. But he ain't dead if thats what you're asking " he replied calmly, his cold expression not leaving his face as he spoke. There. She's alive. He could leave happy now if he wanted too. Hell, why did she even care? The brat almost Kicked her sorry ass.

After a while Xigbar reappeared to the scene where the battled happened. Honestly, he didn't even know why he was going to check on the girl. She wasn't even worth it she was just a puppet, yet something was just telling him too and here he was, looking for her. "Hey, Puppet, where you hiding!" He called out to the other as he looked around a bit more.

He looked down the passed out figure in front of him and sighed. He could do it, he could pull the trigger just like he did all the times before that. But, something was stopping him. Hell, Xehanort probably still wanted him or some shit. He leaned down and looked him over. Eh, he would survive. "Whatever. " he let his weapons disappear before picking up the brat and placing him down somewhere more comfortable. He learned his lesson, hopefully. And so, he pulled out a few potions and left them by Ventus' side. There, he shouldnt be out too long anyway. And with that, he walked away

Xigbar raised an eyebrow when the stumbled, but hell, he wasn't about to complain either. It gave him the advantage he needed to kick his pathetic ass. "Alright, playtimes over" he stated bluntly, looking down to him as he stepped to the side, and with a loud bang, his gun fired hit the other up close, first in the shoulder, then in both knees. He was going to Fuck up. After all, this wasn't Vanitas, if it was he wouldn't be attacking Xehanorts servant. "Stand down, and if you beg I may let you live " he added in all he waited for the other to fall.

So slow, oh, look at that. He thought he was actually being good. How pathetic. He quickly vanished right before the attack could hit him, and the next thing they all knew, he was standing on the ceiling, upside down facing them. "I always hated you the most. Sure, Terra was a pain in the ass, but once we got him under control... It was all smooth from there." He stated with a chuckle before firing a string of shots at the kid, spreading out in different directions but all heading towards Ventus. After that he looked to Xion "You should leave while you can, puppet. You can thank me later~" He then went back to focusing on Ventus, looking down to him looking amused and disgusted all at once. "You were always the weakest Ven, even the greatest keyblade master couldnt teach you shit"

Xigbar has been watching this scene unfold for a while. What could he say? He hated both with quite a passion. A worthless puppet who could barely work, who wasn't even suppose to exist, more so than any one of them, and the brat. Oh, the brat. First he and his friends have to mess with the big bosses plans and make them go prematurely, and then this... Steals the one man he could talk to and snuggle with. The bastard. The little brat deserved to rot in hell for all he did to the nobody. Truly he did, but he didn't know if he would be of any value even still. A shame he wouldn't be able to talk to Xemnas about this, but sure, a few shots wouldn't kill him, right?
"Well, well, well. Still too weak to control what little darkness lies in your heart. Pathetic " Xigbar stated, looking to the scene with a bit of annoyance...

Like guys you don't have rush anything like
Jesus fuck you're all babies don't worry about your love life you're only in high school/ middle school. The person who ends up bragging about kissing/fucking early in their life will either become pregnant by 18, or will continue to have one night stands with people. I have two friends who have lost their virginity at fourteen, both of them so far have also haven't had a relationship that has lasted more than a year, they are now in their twenties. So guys relax, relationships aren't that big of a deal anyway. Your first kiss wont matter unless its with someone you truly love, same if you lose your virginity.

Or my friends who like that stuff
And tbh
Omg I can't believe I'm saying this
The first time I listened to the song "All About That Bass"

Omg so my boyfriend brother and his friends are telling really sexist jokes and one of them was " what's the difference between a washing machine and a woman?"
A: A washing machine doesn't follow you once you drop your load

And so when they went to retell it
I came in with: A washing machine actually gets wet when you turn it on

And their jaws fucking dropped and I proceeded to flip them off and the mother was like " Fuck yeah!"

What the hell
The prom for the high school I went to this year was at the Casino Royale

I wonder if the food was better than when I went to prom my senior year
Junior year the food was fantastic and it was in freaking Santa Barbra next to the beach
Senior year it was in Simi Valley and you want to know what the food was?
Burgers, Waffle fries, French Fries, and tater tots
The joke of the night was "Would you like some fries with those fries?"

People are so happy like "Oh yay Trump is losing yay yay, we don't care why but yay!"
When these people don't seem to realize that the same thing that is happening with Trump is also happening with Sanders. One would think whoever wins the state gets all the delegates, right? That's fair. But both parties are throwing these rules that they rarely use to give the delegates to whoever they want too. Practically making the people's vote even more useless

Even Trump likes Sanders more than Hilary
He basically called out that the government is crazy corrupt and that Sanders should be having a chance
But since it's so corrupt, Sanders is losing
Because even though Bernie Sanders has been winning, Hilary has been getting all the delegates and super delegates
In Wyoming he won by 12%, but lost as far as delegates. I mean
It practically makes the people's vote not matter-

Oh my god that was so pathetic
Like I've seen vaild reasons not to vote for trump like he's a sexist pig
And I'm not voting for him
But that
I'm sorry that was bad

Heyyo
So I encountered someone who was sexist and was a bit rude to me about it so
If you RP and this guy messages you, just be careful.
I feel the need to inform you guys because no one should have to experience sexism, even if its something small like this.
His URL is the same as his name atm, just please stay safe and if someone is rude like
Just block their sorry ass, they don't deserve your time.

And I just wrote this:

I'm gonna be honest one thing I like about Rubio is that he promotes trade schools

Ayyyye
Cruz came in third in the debates in Neveda
This is gonna be political don't mind me
But what I think is gonna happen
Once the guy from Ohio drops out (He got like 3.6) his votes will go to Rubio because Rubio is more middle of the road than Cruz, who is very far right
While Carson (who got like 5.6) will go to Cruz. Maybe. Carson got the religious people on his side, and they tend to be more conservative. And Cruz is v v v v far right. It's going to be very close between Rubio and Cruz. And this is very important. Because these are the two that will be fighting Trump for the Republican spot because remember... The Republicans don't want Trump. They actually think he is democratic which is funny. Don't be so quick to hate Republicans because they hate trump too. Though Rubio has been gaining popularity, which is good because like I said, he is more middle of the road. So he won't be shutting down programs, and he actually has his own ideas on how to help students with college debt. It cool, yar yar

When I was driving with my friends to little Tokyo
Of course the topic of politics came up
And they were like
"Eh, I haven't been paying too much attention, but I heard good things about Sanders"
And I just kinda look at them and reply, "His plans will increase taxes by over 50% The money for that free college gotta come from somewhere"
And they looked at me surprised
What really pissed me off was when I was looking into Sanders and his policies and there was no money
Like he said "Oh I'm gonna raise the taxes of the wealthiest 2% of the population"
Okay??
By how much????
"I'm going to close the loopholes that prevents businesses from skipping out on taxes, and then, tax them more!"

Okay
I know many of you are probably going to disagree with me
But there's the whole thing where people are complaining that there isn't enough diversity in the oscars this year
And I think
When it comes down to it
A good movie is a good movie, race shouldn't matter
I'm sorry Bride of Spies, which is a movie that takes place in the 50's is historically accurate
Or The Revenant, which was based on a true story, stayed true to the characters
Or Carol, that had to do with a same sex couple in the 20's, didn't have diversity
Now you may be like "OH BUT THE HATEFUL HAD A BLACK GUY AND IT WAS A WESTERN"
Okay
Did you see the movie. Everyone was... Incredible racist and said the n word in an offensive way more times than I could count.
Like idk man
In the end a good movie is a good movie
Idgaf about race when I'm watching unless it's important to the plot
Like it was in The Hateful Eight

And Bush was the only that spoke out against trump
Saying logical things like " We can't do that . You know what kind of imagie that would send to the rest of the world?? We need the other Muslim countries on our side"

One of the youtubers called Undertale one of the most disappointing games of 2015
And she was like
"It was the fans, it's just such a shitty fanbase"

So I played cards against humanity last night
And I have to say the best cards I probably did were:
"Life time: "(The story of Africa)" The story of (Funky fresh rhymes)."
And
"HELP! My son is (Running out of semen)"
Also
"For my next trick, I will pull (The devil himself) out of (Menstrual rage)"

But nothing will beat the extremely racist one I put down back in October
So much so I apologized twenty times after putting it down even though no one was mad at me-

"Lifetime presents: "(A monkey smoking a cigar)" the story of (Black people)"

This conversation between bill and tad reminds me
Of an episode of the twilight zone
Where this guy who feared death made a deal with the devil to make himself immortal
Well, he soon found life to be boring and started to do things that would usually kill a person just for fun
Like jumping out a window or jumping in front of a moving train
Well
When he got bored of that, he wanted to try the electric chair( this show was made in the fifties)
And he killed his wife so he could try it
WELL
oops for him, he didn't get the death penalty
Rather he got... Life in prison
So the devil came back and he wanted to undo the deal
So the devil used the loophole and he died of a heart attack
Yeah being immortal wouldn't be fun

This is also why I will never be religious

So no matter how good you are
No matter how much good you do in the world
What matters is that you believe a man came back from the dead as a zombie while claiming he was the son of god
If you don't
Well ya go to hell
Glad this was summed up in that homosexual debate going on

Sorry anyone who isn't Christian
No matter how good you are you still deserve to rot in hell
All because you don't believe who the father was

if Mary was still alive I would suggest going on one of those shows where they find out who the real father was.

I don't want to join in because the girl got it under control
The only thing I would ask this person if when it came down to voting, whether or not they would actually vote against it
Because if they live in America
Well there's a separation of church and state so
Any arguments talking about religion means nothing

Another thing I hate is that people tag happy things as well

Its like
Why???
If someone gets offended by your happiness then they can go fuck themselves I'm sorry
Bur don't tag something happy thats stupid
If someone gets offended tell them to go out into the real world and get over themselves

You know what I've noticed over the years? How fast the majority of quotev changed their mind the instant tumblr does it
I remember when everyone was shaming the daddy kink. That was an adventure, now everyone yells" don't kink shame!!!"

Same goes for body shaming
Now, I'm not saying its bad that these are no longer being shamed
I completely agree that no kink or body shape should be put down
But for the longest time they were calling everyone who they didn't like sluts because of how thin they were
And then there was a whole movement where it stopped
Which I was happy about I thought that was awful
But I think my favorite is the tagging
I both love and hate it at the same time
Like, some stuff it makes sense, gore, nsfw, shit like that
Okay that's all good and dandy
But its so hard to not to comment when someone uses nsfw and then its not nsfw
I shit you not
Someone used that tag when they said fuck
And they were not even using it in a sexual way.

Wait
I just thought of something
Usually if you're on the right side you're not for universal heath care
But also
If you are on the right side you are usually pro life

And you know what's expensive
Birth control
So if we get better universal health care and make birth control cheaper
Then more people have access to it
And if more people have access to it
Than there's less unwanted pregnancies and thus less abortions

Idk ignore my thoughts
Its way more complicated than this because we don't have much money for universal heath care and it shouldn't be run by the federal government but rather the states
Because then there's less people and easier to manage.
States need more power
Less federal
Political parties are destroying the country thank you have a good night

Oh, the console wars. Even I can find myself in this at times. For I am not pure and perfect, no matter how much I appear to be. I too have yelled at my boyfriend, “This is a sony family!” Everytime he asks if I would like to play Xbox with him.
In the end, all of them can play call of duty so they’re all trash anyway. Kidding, slightly.
Yes, I’m talking about the PC. Oh, how the PC users laugh at those lower than them, or the people who use Xbox or Playstation. How feeble and stupid they are since they don’t realize that the best way to game is through the PC
Well, not surprisingly, the rest of the people were playing app games on their phones, which is apparently considered an actual game. Excuse me, I’m a true gamer, my high score on flappy bird is ten, don’t mean to brag.

" little jimmy is an eleven year old boy who has been suffering from a serious illness that is hard to cure. It is a disease found in almost every video game player ranging from the age of 8 and up. Everyone, this serious disease is known as ignorance, and today I'm going to convince you why every gaming system is great in its own way, and why handheld, console, and PC games all deserve a little love.
Oh, the console wars. Even I find myself im this at times. For I am not pure, no matter how much I appear it. I too... Have yelled at my boyfriend, " this is a Sony family!" Everytime he asks if I would play Xbox with him. "

The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said a 30cm (1ft) tsunami was registered on the southern Nakanoshima island, part of Kagoshima prefecture.

There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.

A tsunami warning issued for Kagoshima and Satsunan islands was later lifted. The quake happened at a depth of about 10km (six miles).

They're fucking human too

But this tattoo will always symbolize the new friends I've made here. And though we've only know each other for a few short months, I really hope we can have a nice long lasting friendship.

// Oh fun story
I had to go back to my old high school because I have to get my transcripts and give them to moorpark
But when I got there it was 4pm cause I had class until 3:30 and the office closes at four. But my friend was with me and I decided to take her on the tour of the high school because she's never seen an outdoor high school before.
WELL
As we're walking past one of the classrooms.
I'm like, "I wonder if my old french teacher is still here."
And we go up to her door and open it and she's in there.
And I'm surprised because most teachers go home by then and I say "What are you doing here??"
And she looks at me surprised and is like "Me? What are YOU doing here, didn't you graduate??"
It was fun-//

The way Spoops can make all these different characters and make them all unique is something special. I haven't rped with most of this person OCs cause what are they are at now... 325
YEah, 325 OCs, and from what I've seen. They're not OP or Mary sue/ Gary sue. Which is pretty god damn impressive.

Every time my sister gets hurt
She goes really loudly:
OW OW OW OW OWWWW OW OW
and you know one of my parents just comes running in to make sure she's okay
And its usually just something small and its so fucking annoying
Like, even last Halloween when I slip on something and almost fractured my elbow. I didn't even scream and tried to shrug it off.
Like for real's she's twenty and she does that like a fucking six year old

Like idk if its because I'm cis but I honestly don't care about gender
You're a boy, you're a girl? Neato I don't care
Your genderfluid or trans?
Flameio hotmen I don't care I'll call you whatever pronoun you want
Just don't make like
Make it define who you are because you're more than just a fucking gender
Also, I call everyone a pure goddess, gurl, man, guy
Idgaf what gender you are, you're being called a pure goddess

// my dream was so fucking weird
It was like a mixture of kingdom hearts, SpongeBob, but had the kids from either Goosebumps or rise of the guardians.
But in my dream I flat out realized it was a dream for a little while, it didn't last because it switched and I was no longer the main character
But I told the person" it doesn't matter this is a dream "
And they looked at me like I was crazy. So I closed my eyes, hoping it would work because usually it doesn't. And said, " I want a butter finger" and I open my eyes and there's a Butterfinger in my hand. And I did the same thing with an iPhone six, death note. Yeah it was fun
But what I found funny was that when when I said it was a dream the first time, the realization came over me that I actually was and then I started to lucid dream //

How did you do it? I'm curious. I always pretended to be rebellious... Or, actually was being rebellious. But it was fun to pretend that I got some inspiration from Xigbar.

Believe me, he yells and yells and yells until he's red in the face. I've made a game out of it. I count the seconds until his face starts turning red, if that shows how often I've made him mad.

Excuse me? I have a job, I'm making money, I have friends outside of this place. I moved out of this hell hole, the only reason I was coming back was to check on Larxene and Even. I live on my own. I'm only nineteen, Axel, or Lea, whatever you prefer to call yourself, why should I care if I'm single? You don't need to be in a relationship to be happy, what matters is your friends, the ones you can always fall back on.

Today a kid at the high school I use to go to died today. I actually knew the kid. He was sixteen, funny, and a really nice guy. I liked him a lot and considered him a friend. He had curly hair and I played with it a lot.
He was just a nice guy. No ones quite sure why hes dead. Everyone in band is thinking it was suicide. Someone in my English class said " I would never of thought he would do it"
And I replied with " its always the ones no one expects"
Just... You never know what someone could be going through, high school was rough on me, and I've had thoughts of suicide throughout it. Sometimes I think that if I've never met my boyfriend, I may of been dead by now.
Just.. Just be nice to people, and show them that you care. You never know when you can save someone's life.

// Tbh it bugs me when people say "Oh ha Californians can't drive in the rain lol!"
like no you don't understand
It's not only because it doesn't rain often
BUT ALSO
SINCE IT DOESNT RAIN OFTEN
The streets are covered with oil, and it doesn't get washed away by constant rain.
So when it does rain, all the oil that sank down into the street comes up, and the roads are extra slick. Take a turn a little too fast and the road is still drying?
Better hope there's no one in the other lane driving by cause bitch you gonna skid
Hell, one time I took a turn at NORMAL SPEED and I skidded, and it took me a second to get control of the wheel, and it wasn't even raining the streets were drying from the rain the previous night //

Someone taught them, to be sure, but they were not products of a school system, and not one of them was ever "graduated" from a secondary school” (Gatto).

Ienzo looked down at their so called leader. He rolled his eyes, he was weak, how could their leader just break down so easily? A few images of his dead brother, an illusion of his dead fiancee and he falls to the ground crying?! Unbelievable. He walked up to the other, giving the assassin a strong kick into the gut, causing him to cough heavily as he looked up to the scientist.
"Ienzo, why?" He asked him, looking up at the other, a look of fear in his eyes, "What have I done wrong to cause this?"
"I would never be able to do this to Even, and if I did this to the other, he would throw a fit, so you were my next top choice," he said with a sick, twisted grin, his eyes showing no remorse.

She is literally the definition of perfection, look it up and there she is.
She is probably one of the best friends I have ever had in my life, I'm going to flat out say that. Because it's god damn true. I have known her for over three years, and she lives on the other side of the country, but she has been there for me through thick and thin, more so than my friends who live here have.
So, she's a pure goddess basically.
And she's my long lost sister and I love her to pieces.

""What annoys you??"""

// YOU KNOW WHAT GRINDS MY GEARS
When people only listen to music because of the people's looks. For example, I have a few friends who like SWS, PTV, those bands. And they're just like, "OMG THEY'RE SO CUTE <3 <3 ""
And I'm like, yeah, they're good looking I guess, but the music dou-
"OMG THEY'RE SO CUTE I WANNA MARRY ALL OF THEM"
And the same goes for my friends who listen to KPOP bands
Oooooh they DRIVE ME CRAZY. Like, honestly, they only like the bands because they're "cute and dreamy" and I'm just like... No. Stop please, music is more than that can you not-

So, the not as spoopy pumpkins decided to discuss the matter and decided that yes, they would let the spookiest pumpkin become their king. So the cute little spoopy pumpkin became king of the pumpkins.
“Now that you’re king,” The same not as spoopy pumpkin began, “Will you tell us how you became so spoopy?”
The spoopy pumpkin king thought about it for a little while before saying, “Perhaps, if you take over the pumpkin patch right next to ours.”

Once upon a time, in a far away land, there lived a magical little pumpkin. It was a cute little pumpkin, with a spoopy face that made all the other pumpkins just stare in aw. They wanted a face just as spoopy as their pumpkin friend. So one day, one of the pumpkins went up to the cute spoopy pumpkin and asked, “How did you get so spoopy?”
And the pumpkin replied, “I’ll tell you my little secret, if you declare me the king of the pumpkins.”

But no, they really didn't. Saix was already Xemnas' right hand man.

When Zexion first heard the news, he couldn't believe me. No, such a man couldn't fall to a kid such as Riku. It just made no sense! He would have to tell Vex-...Wait... He couldn't. The two men he looked up to most... They were dead. He looked around the rather dark room he was in, the basement of Castle Oblivion, feeling very alone. And there he stood, just hoping that maybe this was some huge sick joke, and one of them would appear, teasing them like the two use too when he was a young child. But no one came. He looked down to the floor and took a deep breath, he wouldn't let tears fall, no... He clenched his fist tightly, it was his turn to face Riku, and he swore the brat would pay for what he had did.

•Shut up and–: Muse tries to make out with everyone that they encounter.

•Take It Off: Muse takes off an article of clothing every time their name is said.

•Truth Potion: Muse has to tell the truth about anything asked for an hour.

•Name: muse will orgasm every time their name is said

•Be my pet: muse is only able to wear a collar, and nothing else. All clothes will disappear, and the collar is irremovable.

•Heat: muse is extremely needy for sex on a biological level, becoming like an animal in heat.

•Sensitive: Muse will be sensitive to the touch, and get completely turned on by the brush of a finger.

"Dilan, wait!" he called out to the other, putting his hand on his shoulder. He couldn't believe just how lucky he was. He took a deep breath, looking up to the other, "I've been brought up believing a lie, I've been told happiest is blessed upon us through wealth and faith." He paused, not entirely sure how to word everything going through his mind, he wanted to say so much to him. "I just wanted you to know that... I love you," he felt a blush coming across his face as he said this. He wanted to look away to hide it, but he kept looking towards him, "Why wait for the silence to be heard when you are the reason I'm in love with the world."

Never in his life had he seen such a messed up scene. He had no idea where he could even be... There was just blood, everywhere. His head pounded as the bright lights shined down on him, looking around slowly, the white and red room was pretty barren, only a table, a tray of medical utensils, them too also covered in blood, and of course the dead bodies. He ran to the nearest door, trying to open it, only to find it locked. "Someone, anyone!?" He called out, trying to get anyone's attention, "let me out of here!"

I live inside my poisoned mind
It leaves me paralyzed
It leaves me paralyzed
My vision's blurred
My words are slurred
I think I might die tonight
This shadow follows me
It always keeps me on the edge
I know that I would never jump
So why can't I step back from the ledge?

I don't know just the thought my friends never included me in any of their get togethers, and my boyfriend hasn't talked to me since Friday.
But honestly, when I hung out with two of my friends yesterday, they talked about all the shit they did during the last summer cause all of them are going to college in fucking northern California
And I never even got a text. They went to the movies, parties, the beach, had sleepovers... And I didn't get a single fucking text. Not even a god damn hello.

"You... You lost it all," He looked at the other confused, how... Just how was this possible?! "Why did you go there? From beyond, you saw it all... Why did you-" he paused, shaking his head to the side, it wasn't important why, what was important was that the person DID do that. "She... Lost her mind," he looked back up to the other, looking very upset, "She... Lost her head, when they called and they said that they thought you were dead." This person didn't have the right to be here! They were suppose to be dead, yet there, the other was just standing there! How. Someone should kick him out of his own mind for having these thoughts he couldn't deny.

He only laughed at the other as he kicked the person to the ground. "You're a fucking fool! Did you really think you could take on me?" He looked down at the other, thinking that the other was nothing but trash, a rat maybe. "You don't know a god damn thing about me, yet here you are, acting like you can walk in and kill me on the spot?" He swung his scythe around, now starting to treat the other like a little play thing, oh, the person would be fun to slowly kill, but he didn't want to do it too quickly, he had to take some time, let himself have a little fun and torture the other first. "But once you do go to hell," He began with a smirk, "Do tell the devil I'm not too far behind."

"What will it take to keep us together?" He said weakly to the other, he felt like a fool for what he did, he felt so low, so fucking lost in his life. And now the other wouldn't say a word to him, he felt so ashamed, how he hated himself right now. "Please, keep me close, I need to hear your voice," He paused, looking down at the ground, "I don't think I can do this on my own." Oh, how he wanted to run to the other, how he wanted to beg on his knees for forgiveness. "Please, tell me what I can do to make it up to you, anything at all." He needed him, the man kept his head above water, he helped him feel alive, he didn't want one stupid mistake to tear what they had apart.

He stared quietly at the other for a few moments. His eyes showed that of fear as he collapsed onto his knees, clenching onto his stomach which bled out. He was defeated, him, the so called Graceful Assassin, the master of death. They said the truth would set him free, yet he was still here, fighting to stay away from the one thing he caused most. His scythe lay at the side of him, how he wished he had the energy to keep on fighting instead of looking like a fool. But instead, he slowly looked up to the sky, muttering the words, "God... If you are above, is this the way you wanted things to be?" He paused, the pain in his stomach unbearable, "Did I live my life the way I could... The way that I should?"

Lumaria glared at the other, sickened by what the person had done, " Do you think yourself better than those around you?" He asked, anger growing inside of him, "We are no different, can you not see this?!" He shook his head, summoning his scythe and slowly walked towards the other, "No one knows why this happens, or why we do what he do, but in the end, we all end up dead!" He swung his scythe, not to attack the other, just to prove his point, "So why, why do you people think you can just avoid it!"

"...Misery," He shook his head at the other, laughing a little as if everything about that word should be taken as a joke. "I'll never be what you want me to be, I do hope you realize this." He looked up at his other half, a smirk spread across his face, "Can you not see this?" He asked as he patted the other's head. "At first, I was in doubt about all of this, seeing you and the lies you put up around me. But now, I realize, I don't wish to be with you, and I don't want you with me." Oh, a part of him wanted to slap the other, but he resisted, and just kept the same smirk towards him, "So stop trying to play the hero, honestly it's repulsing."

STORY TIME:

// Yesterday my friend and I kept going back to Joanns cause we are making Marluxia's scythe
And of course, we were both getting easily distracted, now, by the second time going there, I didn't want to come back afterwards, and as we were heading back to the ashier people to buy our shit, we see Halloween candy
And my friend was like, "OOOOH MY GOD LOOK AT THAT." And she started to head towards it, to which I quickly yelled back:
"NO, NO WE ARE LEAVING, RESIST." And I grabbed her by the arm and started to pull her away
"B-BUT"
"NOT BUTS RESIST IT," And I keep dragging her away
And as I'm doing this, we are heading towards some later holding a giant N, the ones used for paper mache and that shit. And she's like, "Is that what true friendship is?"
To which we are both like "HELL YEAH, WE ARE AWESOME! FRIENDSHIP."
And that is my story

// SO YOU WANT SOME HISTORY???
HERE

Unhappy about the unfavorable terms of trade in China, British merchants hit on a possible solution in the form of opium, which was frown in the hills of eastern India. Although opium was also a growth in China, the Indian variety was far more potent and was soon in great demand in the Middle Kingdom. By the early 19th century an annual average of 4500 chest of opium, each weighing 133 pounds, were sold, either legally or illegally, to merchants on the south China coast. By 1839, on the eve of the Opium War, nearly 40,000 chest were imported by the Chinese.

Cold. It was the one word that could describe the poor man; his arms wrapped about himself in such a way that showed the morning could not rise soon enough, his short and shallow breaths could be seen as he tried to take another step forward. Though, he only collapsed to the floor once again, the cold was almost taking over him as he struggled to stay alive. He looked to his fist, the now blood stained cover picture was now bent, but the image of the man’s family could be seen, knowing that on this day, he would never be able to see them again.

Omg this girl blocked me because I was question her about her boyfriend-
I'm cracking up
I was questioning to her mostly because she said she has known this guy for three years but she had never heard his voice
and I'm like
Is it a long distance relationship?
And she was like, "No, he's gonna move right next to me!"

Real quotes yo, leaving out the name cause I'm not that much of an asshole:
Person: wait hang on someone's knocking on my door*drops kindle* omfg
You: ...
Person: he's here early omg he just kissed me Awh his voice is so sexy it is nice and deep

Remember doing confessions cause I'm not really addicted to anything

I was actually planning on breaking up with my boyfriend a week into our relationship, but then I had a dream that I broke up with him, and really regretted it later
So I decided not to break up with him and hey almost two years later we are still together

Um,
If a day goes by and I don't listen to music
My anxiety rises and I sink into one of those depressing state of minds.
Like sometimes it last for days even if I start to listen to music again, it's also really bad.
Which is why I don't like doing sleepovers that much because none of my friends like the same music as me.

Cuddling with him and then you messed around with his hair, only to soon pass out afterwards.

You? Sleep around? Ha, you're lucky Mar Mar feel in love with you, which you should be thankful for because he's probably the most perfect nobody I know. Please, you're more loyal to your lab work, you probably show affection for it than you do Mar Mar. But what would I know? *he said sarcastically* I just sleep around with everyone, I'm incapable for having true feelings for someone because I'd fuck anything that's over 18!

"You, what do you think you're doing here?" The man asked with disgust as he looked at the other. This person... Has messed with him for too long, anything that came out of her mouth filled with anger. Well, she was lucky that she was still alive at this point, really, anything. "You always said you had the right intentions, you fucking liar." He practically snarled at her. What was she doing here, she didn't deserve to live, he would kill her for free if it ever came up. Why was he letting her get to him, she shouldn't mean a thing to him now. "Why are you still in my life!"

Really, now, Vexen? *he glared at the other, getting on a touchy subject* Because you suddenly know everything about me? I'm not like my other half completely, though the same in appearance , we seem to have different memories. You know nothing about being loyal to the one you love, /nothing/.

"Ah, Bonjour Louise," He found himself smiling at the other, it was a genuine smile, one that did appear too often on this man. "The hours we have spent together have filled with heart with nothing but joy, and for that I am grateful." She was here, actually here, when she was torn away from him back when they were kids, he thought he would never see her again, but here she was, by his side once again. This time it would be different, that he would promise himself as he offered her what every princess deserved. A home, a friend... even something more if that was what she wanted. For when he was with her, he felt completed, like he had a purpose again. "Waking up with you has been a blessing, I just..." He paused, a lost of words, something that also never happened, "Whatever you wish, I will give to you." He bowed to her in respect, summoning both a yellow and red rose, holding them out, "I would prefer you picked both, but if you only want one, then one it shall be."

"So," he paused for a moment, looking up at the man who was before him, "Vanitas, I never expected the stories to be true." He wasn't sure whether to be fearful of this man or welcoming, after all, to be created by the Superior's somebody, impressive to say the least. A being made entirely from the darkness of another's heart, incredible. "Though I must say, it is an honor to meet you," He bowed in respect, though still kept his guard up, unsure how the other would react, " Gravedigger."

// Gonna make this towards your Marluxia//


"Hello again, old friend," he said, looking towards the other with a devious grin. Oh, how he envied the other, he was loved, nice, an incredible person, everything this Marluxia knew he would never be. His better half, he knew where his life was going, was married to a man he loved, and it filled the other with jealousy. " I do hope you're enjoying yourself," he spoke in a nicer tone, trying to hide how much he wanted to tear out the other throat... No, he didn't want to do that. He couldn't, for he also loved and cared for this man like the others did, how could he not? The man was perfect, and himself? A sinner, a fighter, everything that should of been wrong with him, but no, instead someone else took it away from him. Yet... He could never hate the man. "I wish nothing but the best for you." His grin turned into a smile as he patted the other's back.

He looked towards the other in a curious manner, "Tell me, do we know when we fly, and when we go, do we die?" He found himself chuckling, knowing the stupids words he spoke meant nothing, everyone dies, everyone suffers, so why does it matter when? He summoned his scythe, pressing it up against the others neck, wanting to see the fear in the other's eyes, "The ghost are waiting for you, you disgusting thief." He slowly moved the blade across the others neck, Marluxia himself staying cheerful, while the blood slid out of the others body.

Gone, everything he wanted in his life... Just gone, taken away just like that. "Give it back to me!" He screamed at the other, praying to god his threats were not empty. He knew he was wrong about everything, everything little thing he ever knew was wrong. And it was all because of the person that stand on the other side of him, "My god, you never listened! Don't you hear me, I want it back!" He summoned his scythe, ready to fight the other to the death if he had too. But... He couldn't, no... For if the other was gone, another thing would be lost, never to be returned to him. Out of anger, he slammed his scythe on the floor, "Damn it! Damn it all!"

He looked at her, hurt remaining in his eyes as he collapsed to the ground, wondering how this could of happened. He longed for her to return, yet even the sight of her made Marluxia wish to scream out in rage. "W-why," he stuttered, feeling as if a dagger had struck his heart, "Why do you do this to me?" He didn't even feel like himself anymore, this wasn't like him. Never in his life had he allow a human to do this much damage to him. "D-don't leave me..." he felt his eyes begin to water up, he hated her... At least, he wanted too. "Don't let the light die in me yet, I'm not ready for the cold of the darkness."

Finally, the time had come. To watch this girl fade away from his life forever, "I told you I would break and destroy you." He said to her in amusement, summoning his scythe and watching the blood drip down her neck. "You shouldn't of done that awful thing, cheating is not something I allow," he found himself laughing a little as he dug the scythe in her back. "Now scream for me, and disappear forever."

He grinned at the other as he watched the poor man suffer, perhaps this was a little too cruel, slowly watching the man die right before his eyes. Did he deserve it? Oh, no, he was so innocent, so pure. "This is what you get for trusting me," he grinned, looking the man straight in the eye. He felt like the biggest asshole, but he would kill anyone for the right amount of money, even the man he loved. "Accidents happen."

She has major trust issues and if she doesn't like or trust you she will trick you into thinking she does so she can learn your secrets and then manipulate you to do her bidding. Sometimes, not all the time. She's a bitch, basically. A snarky little bitch with no self confidence.

You stand so proud behind those above you, but really, beneath all that, you're nothing. You say you can stand up against me, when there are moments when you cannot even stand up for yourself.
You're a man of science, as I am a man of death. Both taking pride of our works, but in the end, we both have innocent blood on our hands. You're not bigger than me, your threats are the ones that are empty.
Tell the Superior. I don't care, he doesn't like me and I don't like him.
And never in my life here in the organization have you shone an ounce or respect for me, so why should I do the same? Respect isn't given, it's earned, after all. So why would anyone be nice to you, when you yourself treat everyone like they're inferior beings.

... Oh, it's a romantic story. And it aaaaall took place in... France, yes, you guessed it. It was a cool summer's evening. The flowers were blooming and I decided to take the girl I was with out for a nice walk while the sun was setting. Oh, how beautiful the scenery was. Well, we decided to take some wine with us as well as we headed for the hilltop, looking over the small town I called home. And we talked and talked for hours on end, I swear, the dress she had on was something so beautiful I can not even describe it. And, as we sat there... Watching the sun go down, she leaned on me, and we both turned our heads at the same time to look at each other and... Damn, I wish I could go back to those days.

Showing anger is pointless, your enemy won't fear you if you seem upset or perhaps even threatened by them. To remain calm and to keep a clear mind will help keep you in charge.
This applies to foreplay as well.

Dear boyfriend,

I'll try my best not to be sarcastic but it'll probably end up being sarcastic, out of love of course.

Well, we are approaching two years. Two years we've been able to actually love each other, and since this my first relationship... It means a lot to me. Like, I don't know. I love you a lot. Like your long hair, and your personality, yourdick #puregoddess and really our time together.
You're amazing and incredible and even though you hate compliments, I'm going to keep telling you them, because damn it they're true and you deserve to hear them, no matter what you tell yourself
I love you, okay?
Thank you for dealing with me at 2am when I call you crying because my mind went off the deep end, thank you for just dealing with all of my shit.
You're the best
And I love you for that

Dear Good Friend,

What the FUCK- Oh wait good friend. Sup, we sat next to each other in one class for one semester
And you were pretty chill
Tbh I found it really cool that you were from Russia, and also you gave REALLY good massages like damn a little upset that you never showed me how
But still, you supported me the day I had to confront my parents about me maybe being depressed.
We both talked and laughed and cheated on test together and overall you were a blast
I'll miss you D: Also made you were a junior and I was a senior
OH
But that girl that sat behind us, the other junior, I saw her at Moorpark college and it was cool!

Dear Younger Me,

How young? I don't know. 3rd grade? Everything will be alright, it'll be a long road for you, but everything will be alright. I know it's just began, it's going to last until freshman year. But... Just because Dad stopped screaming at you, doesn't mean you have to keep doing it to yourself. Let it go, please, your life will be so much better, and you'll be so much happier.
6th grade? Hey, I know it seems rough, but after sixth grade, 7th and 8th are a little better, you have your friends, and though you're still struggling, you'll make it through. Have fun, it's just school, don't worry, you're going to make it through.
9th grade? Hey, look at me, you're worth it, you're beautiful you're incredible, stop telling yourself you're not. Stop telling yourself you're not worth it, and stop the thoughts of ending your life. Look at me now, I'm in college, I have a boyfriend, I have so many close friends (Mostly on the internet) Life gets better, don't give up on me, I believe in you. Love you <3

"""You and your muse at Disneyland""""

//Alright, Marluxia, listen the fuck up. We are going to stay here until closing, I know this park by heart. I hope your feet are ready, because we are going to shit ton of walking and standing in lines. You want to go to California adventure? Fuck you that can wait we are going on ride after ride after ride. We'll get fast passes for Indian Jones and then go wait in line for Space Mountain. I know a great place to eat in the new Orleans area, we will have dinner and live off this bottle of soda alright lets go. //

Marluxia: .... What she said. She uh... Seems to know what she is doing

//Also we are going on Matterhorn during the fireworks show, best time to go on that ride, and we are not watching the Disneyland parade it's not worth it//

Marluxia: Shit-

Oh yeah my boyfriend's mom gave me an idea for a story and I'm excited
All she said was, "They need to sell child's energy, people would buy that shit"
And my mind instantly went to a future where children have their energy sucked right out of them and made into some sort of drink. Like these children are stolen from homes or sold to them and it's a huuuge million dollar industry. And once these kids have their energy stolen from them, it's like a really cruel process that would really damage the kid emotionally.
But it would focus on a CO or something, and his journey as he really finds out what happens to the kids.
Idk something like that it popped into my head and haven't thought of it until now.

One was caused by a car crash, and due to the winds it started up a brush fire, this one is near Santa Barbra
And the other one is at the canton pass? I think
Anyway for anyone in California and decided to head south

I had an important reminder of why I never show my sister the music I listen too.
I was showing her "Never Giving Up" by Of Mice And Men
And she didn't say anything throughout the whole song, but when I said I was going to turn on Disney Music and change it, she said, "Oh finally?"
And I asked, "You didn't like it?"
She replied, "Not at all, there was just too much background noise."
And I'm sitting there, thinking, "Did you not even take the time to listen to the lyrics?? My god.Not even appreciate them??"
And I may hate rap, but I always listened to it in the car when I was with some friends, and I listened to the muisc, and I mostly hate rap because of the lyrics, some of them have good lyrics, don't get me wrong, and I can at LEAST appreciate it because it actually means something but UGH THE LYRICS come ooooon.
At least my sister admits she's ignorant.

"write a poem to that someone special"

Arguments
Something every relationships have
Whether I'm pmsing
Or you're just plan retarded
We get through them, you and I
Everyday we live through the day
Each other in the mind
Longing for that next time we may embrace
We are strong, loving, forgiving
You're my only lover, the only one I trust
When the tears start to fall, I look up, and all I see is you
The guiding light away from my sorrows
The warmth away from the armed cold
Never did I dream of a love we have
Nor did I think I would ever deserve
From the moment when you first held my hand
To the touch if our lips for the first time
Never did I believe we would last so long
And so happy, even through those dreaded times
When the happiness seemed to fade
And we were left with those arguments
But grew past them, and became stronger
And so did the trust between us

This was bad I had like three hours of sleep last night and I should be in bed now

THE PERSON IS A ONE DIRECTION FAN

The #cutforzayn thing really pisses me off. I don't care if he leaves, I don't like the group. But even if you do care, doing something like that is stupid and you need serious help. If you are planning on doing that, unfollow or block me. I want nothing more to do with you.

I have no idea what's going on, but apparently there's a porn account on here right now. It will get deleted, but people are like, "OMG DONT YOU HAVE A TUMBLR, ITS NOT A BIG DEAL"
And this reminds me of a different matter on tumblr, there was a post that said, "If you can't deal with porn, then why on you on tumblr?"
Well, I'm gonna connect the two issues by saying this.
It does matter. Tumblr is suppose to be all about supporting people and saying, "it's okay if you don't like sex, and it's okay if you do!"
Well, some people fucking don't like sex, and don't like fucking seeing it, EVER. Is that a hard concept? No, it isn't. Some people can't tolerate the sight of it. Get over it and stop calling people out.

I was looking at an article, "8 MORE Completely Inappropriate Kidz Bop Songs"

And one of the songs was All About That Base.
I thought the lyrics were better than the original.
Just for this difference.
Original: Ya my mamma she told me don't worry about your size
She says boys like a little more booty to hold at night

Kids Bop: Ya my mamma she told me don't worry about your size
She says don't let it keep you at home in your room at night.

And I think that is a better message to send, and it could relate to more people. But that's just me

Me: *comes home and goes into the tv room, noticing my sisters and my mom just finished a movie*
Sister one: What should we watch next?
Me: Is it cool if I play Kingdom Hearts?
Sister one: Yeah, we're all playing our DS
Sister two: yeah it's cool.
Mom: Alright, but if anyone wants to watch something, you have to turn it off.
Me: Okay. *puts the game in the PS3 and starts it up*
Sister One: Wait I thought we were gonna watch Twilight Zone.
Mom: You didn't say you were against her playing though
Sister One: Well I just assumed we were gonna watch it
Mom: Okay, turn it off then.

So on pokemon...

This guy wanted to trade with people. So I was like sure why not.
Well, this poor guy had practically nothing compared to me, and everything he had, I had as well. He even had a mew, which I'm sure was his big thing, but I had one too and a bunch of other event pokemon. Eventually he offered a level 2 Zigazoon, and I felt so bad I had to give him something, so I gave him a Mr. Mine for it.

Do you ever just close your eyes and imagine blood just dripping? Like water droplets from a sink, that empty dripping noise that calms you, yet keeps you awake. What would happen if you came home one day and found a family member strung up to the ceiling, their chest impaled by a long knife, cuts running all down their arms. Now, it wouldn’t be a shower of blood because by the time you got there, it was already mostly drained. You would probably close your eyes, yes? And then you would hear it, the steady dripping of blood falling to the floor, incredible, it sounds just like plain old water. Dear me, dear my. I do love that sound, maybe the next time you hear water dripping, you best let someone else take care of it.

They'd be like, "Omg that's not very punk of you."

A great song to write too in my opinion:
www.youtube.com/watch?v=crVgAaYWehE

I remember listening to this song on the last day of summer vacation, it was a beautiful sunny day, and I just stared out my window, looking at the freshly cut green grass and felt the heat shinning through my bedroom window, there wasn't a cloud in the sky and I remember just feeling happy. I had just beaten Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories, and I was wondering what to do with the rest of the afternoon. Then I remembered this song, and decided to do just that, have a lazy afternoon, and I just wrote a few really short stories. And I look upon that day fondly, and wishing for more days like that to come soon.

Though the book that made me stop reading teenfiction was a Science Fiction, Romance called Origin.
I randomly bought it because idk why it seemed interesting.
Boy was I right, that plot was amazing just:
Pia has always known her destiny. She is meant to start a new race, a line of descendants who will bring an end to death. She has been bred for no other purpose, genetically engineered to be immortal and raised by a team of scientists in a secret compound hidden deep in the Amazon rainforest.

Sounds interesting, right?
Oh my god it was, that plot was amazing. I was glue to that book. And you know what made me want to burn that book? The love plot, even worse, the boy she fell in love with was her cousin. Romance killed that plot and I have yet to go back to teenfiction cause ew

DONT MAKE THE GIRL FALL IN LOVE WITH THE ZOMBIE NO STAPH, THAT'S NASTY AND ILLEGAL

Writing horror stories like:
Five minutes of walking later the group reaches a one story, white building. Fox stops the group before they could enter and points to a patch of dirt besides the building, “Now, what is that?” he says, overly happy. I take a few steps closer to what he is looking at to see that is just a piece of crap. I try to hold back a groan because I know what is coming, that dreadful, annoying song.
A blissfully unaware kid then raises his hand, “isn’t that poo-“
“Shh!” Fox cuts off the boy, “We all know what this is, but for the next three days we are going to be scientist, so we must speak like one!” I roll my eyes as he clears his throat and starts to sing, “Hey, what’s that on the ground! Come now, children, let’s see what it is! It comes out of you, it comes out of me! I know what you’re thinking, but don’t call it that! Let’s be scientific and call it scat!” He finishes and looks around, everybody is either laughing or holding back a laugh.

But then I would be associated with the people who write the FNAF's Character X reader stories

Why do some people get so snippy when you critique a song.
Like
Every song a band/ artist makes has their flaws
We're just speaking our opinions and I don't think they care because they are making millions (Taking about the huge groups)

So I just finished the Timmy/ Jimmy power hours
and like
The last episode of Jimmy Neutron was in 2005, and the second power hour was made in 2006.
With this in mind, they already had the episodes which concluded that Jimmy and Cindy were totally a thing
But then Cindy totes ditched him the momment Timmy comes into the picture
Leave her Jimmy, she isn't loyal!!

I would like to request a moment of silence for those who lost their lives fighting in World War One, the original reason this holiday was created. On November 11th, 1919, the peace treated was signed to end the war... Though due to slow transportation of the message, 3000 more men lost their lives from fighting. It was the war to end all wars, to which now we know was not true.
In honor of Veterans Day, or Armistice day, just a moment of silence for those who lost their lives, and to smile upon those who have fought/ are fighting for our countries.

So after school I drove myself to the grocery store to pick up some chips for a party tomorrow
And on the way back, I drove past the middle school I use to go to. Now it was like 12:50pm (I get out of school at noon) and they were out having lunch. And at first I was like "hahaaa sucks to be them!"
But then I realized, "Shit, I'm graduating high school this year" and that college is coming up and it was ugh
Then I grinned when I saw the speed limit was 40 and yey

I can't wait to see your brilliant face
Congratulations, break a leg tonight
Through sadness you have taught us to be one with the crowd
My life is like a video game
I'm gonna try to try to focus
And I feel, I feel so alive again
Don't waste your time, it will never work
Give me a smile, give me your, girl.
I see the world through these shame color glasses.
On behalf of her love

Well
It seems summer is now over for me. I had a really good one, hanging out with friends, online and in person. And just relaxing, really, that's all I wanted to do.
For the people I am editing stories for: I'm sorry, this summer I was just not inspired to write or really just work for that matter. I'm sorry I was a complete lazy ass this summer, but now that school is starting I will be working again believe it or not.
Good luck everyone with school this year. This is going to be my last year of high school, and I plan to make it a good one.
Stay beautiful you beautiful souls <3

So there was this post on tumblr where this girl was mad because some people didn't know there was a Canada day.
And she said something like, "Yes there is one! Maybe if you went outside and into the real world maybe you would know there is more to the world than America!!"

Excuse me. I'm sure there is plenty of people in Europe and Asia who don't know/don't care about Canada day either, she needs to grow the fuck up.
Stop Stereotyping Americans, not all of us are dumb fucks.
Not everyone knows about our Independence day either, you don't see us getting offended and being a butthurt peasant

In my dream last night, Justin Beiber settled down, got married and had a kid. And nobody trashed talk about him anymore, he just faded away.
Until he was careless and his kid died under his watching
then everyone was like , "CALLED IT"
then it changed subjects

Hello you beautiful souls, I hope you are having a nice day so far!
I'm written this because im hoping someone will reply and help me with this.
I was editing this story, that is posted up above, and a while ago I noticed she deactivated, I don't know know why, she never said goodbye to me..
I was hoping maybe we could continue it, in her honor. One or two people can maybe help me continue on with the story, finish it for her.
I can't write it because she gave me the rules, "You may not continue it for me." So I am bound to that rule.
Now, today is in fact my two year anniversary on quotev, but instead of going me me me! I want to help a friend out, would anyone like to help me with this story?

So in Diablo three
There is a character named Leah. And she is suuuuuuuch a Mary sue.
Her Uncle is Decard Cain. (He's like the all knowing guy who knows everything)
Her Mother is a witch.
AND HER FATHER IS MOTHERFUCKING DIABLO (The big fucking bad guy)
Now, she has a suuuper strong power that she can't control and it only comes out when she is angry.
THAT'S NOT ALL
Everyone feels bad for her and helps her, she NEVER stops talking, she is a master at a bow in Arrow. And she is the victim because Diablo uses her as a vessel. Oh and she's hot.

Harry: Ugh, im the leader of the gang. I hate every one and I will take over everyone. But I LOOOOOOOOOOOVE girl, omg they just fall for my tattoos. I also have a high radius of attracting whiny girls though. But I ALWAYS pity them, because I want the V.
Liam: Hai, um.. Im mostly in the gay love stories, buuut I AM A PUNK, OH YEAH. With my pop music about loving people. Im the bad boy dont you know. FEAR ME AND LOVE ME AND IM GOONNA FUCK YOU YEAH
Zayn: Hello, im the hottest out of all of the others. Fuck me now, I am also a teacher and I fuck any student as long as their hot enough and use plenty of links in their stories. Now lets fuck
Niall: Im cute and all girls want in my pants. Im cute im cute im cute! Im the most innocent and always the virgin. Now fuck me
Louis: Hey ladies.
Fuck me now, I will most likely get you preggers and then leave you and come back later because I remember you're great at sex bye bye now

Another rant:
There is nothing wrong with short chapters.
When people get reviews people sometimes say ,"Make longer chapters."
But longer chapters are not the ingredients for a good writer. For example, Dan Brown. Everyone should know him, he wrote Angels and Demons and The Davinci Code. (both amazing books.) Some of his chapters are less than a page long. One page would be chapter 123, then next page it's 124.
Spread this around. There is NOTHING wrong with short chapters. If chapters are too long, however, then we have a problem.
I sure many people use chapters as a break point when reading.
"Oh, I'll stop at chapter 10 then start blah blah blah."
If chapters are too long, especially online, then people will start skimming through it. It's true. For example.
The Great Gatsby. Yes, it was an amazing book. Over 100 pages spamming the course of eight chapters. The chapters were way. Too. Long. But is it still an amazing book? Yes.
I would just recommend finding middle ground. The length does

Some people are against fanfiction.
Saying it's not real writing and that they could come up with something original.
In some cases, it's true. I've read some fanfiction where it doesn't even have to be a one direction member or supernatural or whatever it is.
But I actually think fanfiction is a wonderful way to begin writing. You already have characters and a plot behind them. Half of your work is done for you and helps the writer focus on their character. The challenge though is keeping the other characters IC (in character). Which is where most fanfiction falls down hill. They become sooooo ooc (out of character), that you might as well change the name of the people and make it your own original story.
But yes, fanfiction is a good place to start writing, though I do recommend moving past it once you figure out your writing style and your type of writing.

Weird fact:
In 1962, an epidemic of laughing broke out in Tanganyika (now Tanzania). Starting among a group of schoolgirls, the laughter spread rapidly, eventually infecting neighboring villages and forcing schools to close. It lasted for at least six months.

That's really scary if you think about it

I honestly hate how teenage pregnancies romanticize the idea of getting pregnant so young.
I have yet to see one story go, "Why was I so stupid! I'm going to ruin my whole life!"
Then the boy say, "Fuck; why wasn't I thinking! I can't be a father, you can't be a mother. We have a future! And we destroyed it!"
"Let's think logically of what to do, I might want to get an abbortion, though I'm not sure yet. I should talk to my parents."

Instead I see:
Girl: NOOOO! I PREGGERS
BOY: SO?
GIRL: I CANT BE PREGGERS
BOY: BUT YOU LOVE KIDS
GIRL: YOURE RIGHT I WANT THIS KID

OR
GIRL: YAY! IM PREGGERS
BOY: OH FUCK NO IM OUT
GIRL: BUT ITS OUR CHILD AND I DONT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT MY FUTURE AT ALL
BOY: NO FUCK THAT SHIT GET AN ABORTION
GIRL: NO NO NO
BOY: FIND ILY LETS GET MARRIED

If anyone made a fanfic about one direction and how they somehow become mute and they slowly start losing their fans because they split up.
That'd be great
Like, only the crazy ass fans would only be left and it would mostly focus on the member's mental state.
Their struggle to have to learn sign language and how their money would soon run out from over spending.
The more I think about it, the more it doesn't even have to be one direction
I might make a story like this hmmm..

I didn't think so either. But you know what? It did. Kyle and I have been dating for six months now and I've never been happier. He gave me the final push I needed to get me out of the hole known as self-loathing. And whenever I trip or fall back in, here's there to help me. Don't think you're going to be alone forever. The average age on here is about 12-17. You're in HIGH SCHOOL, you have your whole life in front of you. This is one of the most stressful times of out life. You just have to wait it out- because it does get better. You just have to hit the bottom of the hole before you can start climbing out.

Okay today was a great day.
So my friends Faith and Logan (they are dating) came over because we have to finish a project for English and Kyle (my boyfriend) also came over because we needed another guy.
So we went hiking, and today was a great day it was like 80 with a slight breeze, and the views were amazing. I actually have a picture. And when we got to the spot we needed to film. We just kinda sat there and watched the view, just talking for an hour. Then after we filmed, we all went back to my house and kyle stayed for dinner. Chatted with me and my sister and played little big planet together. Then we he had to go. We just kinda sat outside and watched the stars and yeah it was really peaceful.
And then I just got to edit the rest of the time. Really nice and amazing..
Here's a picture:

Todays lesson: Rice lovers
Step one:
Say these nine words:
I only like white rice with salt and pepper.

Step two (if you can): sprinkle salt and pepper into your white rice.

I swear every time I see this I always read, "Don't dead open inside."
And it always takes me ten seconds to see what it actually means
So I just sit there like, "Wow that person can't write lol." Then I feel like an idiot

Dear Andrew,
Yes, I know it's been a long time, but hi. I haven't seen you since second grade, but you were the first friend I ever had. When I found out you were moving, I was so sad. You were my only friend and I didn't know what to do. I wish I spent more time with you before you left. Though you were a bit of an ass, you meant everything to me at the time and just thank you for the memories.

Dear ex best friend,
There is no hard feelings between us, we just sorta faded away in elementary school. Then we went to different middle schools and lost contact all together. I really enjoyed the years we had together, playing tigers on the grass at school and introducing me to my friends I still have today.
Thanks Libby. Means a lot to me

Dear boyfriend,

Where to begin...
Thank you for being there for me, these past four months have been the best in my whole life. You make me feel beautiful and that I have a purpose. I know I nag you over energy drinks but I really care about you and I love you more than anything. We really have connected.. and it's really incredible because we have so much in common. It's unbelievable. I don't want it to end. Though this is my first relationship, I hope I'm not bad. I worry that I am not good enough for you and I try my best. And our codes always make me smile. Watching "Disney movies" (making out) and watching, "sherlock." Thank you for everything, it means the world to me and I hope to spend many years to come with you.
"If this love is just a dream, don't wake me up. It's hard enough to face the world alone"
I love you Kyle. <3

I have no idea why I am so mad at this I just am.
Teenagers are going through a time of where their hormones are just so fucked up, they have mood swings, they are under stress they are going through puberty and are getting ready to go into the real world. Some fucking cry themselves to sleep because you arn't there for them. They feel fucking alone. Scientist are calling this the most stressed out generation yet. So how about you stop being a pussy and go fucking support your kid. If you don't want to be around your kid because they are an arrogant bitch. Then that's your fault for being an awful parent.

God I hate most of the people who listen to the same bands as me.
They honestly need to GROW THE FUCK UP
"lol you like bvb because you a fag" Really?
"UGH OM&M NOW SOUND LIKE BMTH" No, they really don't. Stop comparing them.
"dis isn't as good as their previous albums, UGH THEY SUCK NOW " Sorry they can't make everyone happy.
Honestly some people are some immature and hate on each other more than Directioners with non directioners.
I've seen some pretty nasty post about SWS, PTV, BVB especially, BMTH, ATL, ect.
Why? What brings this strong hate? These band too mainstream so you have to hate on them?? Can someone explain this?

So I'm recovering from a cold and I'm basically done, my throat is just a tad bit messed up still. Anyway, my Dad said, "Who wants to go out for ice cream!?"
Me: Can I goo?
Dad: Nah!
So I thought he was joking because he does that a lot, but then when I was walking out with my shoes, he said, "I'm sorry, I just don't want you to get anyone sick."

FINE

If you can't find a dedication,
You're fucked now
The seaweed is always greener
I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
I still remember the night you tried to kiss me through the window.
Black souls, empty bodies
Don't want to be an American idiot
Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings
Make a wish on our sorry little hearts
Embrace the silence

I like the first seven lines the best

"And I realize they may not be perfect, but think about it. They make their fans laugh and just feel good inside. Oh and to all the people who think they're gay, let me tell you something, one of them is engaged."
Some girl said this about One Direction.
A lot of bands make their fans laugh and feel good.
A lot of fans hope they are gay.
AND WE KNOW ONE OF THEM ARE ENGAGED, everyone remembers cut for Zayn.

Idk, this was on a topic called, "What do people see in One Direction."
I'm not being a hater, I just honestly don't see anything special about them.

God this book is hard to read. It's an autobiography about a black woman named Debra J. Jackson and her time growing up in the 1960s.
"Out of all the things to be whipped with....Extension cords were the worst...When it landed, it cut a strip of skin away ans seared the very air from your lungs...The world went white with pain and fury while he used the extension cord on me...He beat me and beat me and beat me. The hand squeezing my throat agaisnt the fixtures... by then, I was clinging to the faucet as if it were a life preserver while the rest of my body bucked and thrashed, unable to escape either Daddy's grip of the cord's reach. "
This happened to her in Six Grade, just damn...

So my nights original plan: Go to bed at 10:30pm
what actually happened: My best friend and I skyped and shipped our boyfriends and the ship name is Myle. And bringing up old inside jokes that equal to sex.

For example: Saying a glass of water is saying lets have sex

So: "MAYBE THEY WILL GET A GALLON OF WATER FOR EACH OTHER"

Here ya go

“We are sorry to inform you, Mr. Moser,” The mysterious man in the suit said,” But she’s dead.”

The smell of coffee filled the air as Mr. Moser went into the kitchen. His wife was out and about making breakfast. It was the same every morning, eggs with toast. Whenever he asked his wife to change it up a little, she just replied, “Just be grateful for what you do have,” and continued cooking for the kids. His two beautiful balls of sunshine; one boy and one girl named Robert and Juliet. Both fairly young, Robert was the oldest at eight while little Juliet was only five. He loved both of his angels more than anything, and sometimes they visited him at work. Only if they got off early from school though, so about once a month. His wife handed him his usually grey coffee cup, filled with coffee. Though when he went to grab it, it slipped through his wife’s fingers and went right to the floor.

This website I am on really figured out how to deal with illegal immigrants :L

Issue: Due to the ongoing wars in neighboring countries, a recent rash of illegal immigrants have been caught at the borders of Jalamacaca, prompting many citizens to call for tighter immigration laws.

Here is one of the solutions:
"Hold on there, hold on people!" says Natalia O'Bannon of the Jalamacaca Broadcasting company, "We don't have to take either extreme, all we have to do is make a TV game show out of it! We put deadly obstacles on the border and monitor it with television cameras! Those that make it across win freedom and citizenship, and those who don't, well, let's just say that our buzzards won't starve. We could call it 'Who Wants to be an Immigrant?'!"

"I've got an idea," says theme park tycoon, Lindsay Tew. "My company will happily sponsor the new establishment and cover all costs - as long as it's made to our specifications. We've already got plans drawn up to put a roller coaster straight through the House of Commons! A cafe, some kiosks for ice cream... maybe even a water slide or two in the lobby! It'll be one part legislative seat of government, one part family-fun theme park! Tourists will flock from around the globe!"

I don't know... A lot of my followers are upset, they cut and I want to help them... But I don't know how.. So here is some facts

If you live in the United States, you are probably richer than 50% of the world. You have a working toliet, 1.5 billion people don't.
Women, you can wear skirts, shorts, you can vote, you can live on your own. Millions of women can't. You can worship whatever you want without fear, about 33 million cant.
I know these are just random facts that I learned in sociology. But it makes me feel lucky, even if the United States government is curropt, we have many things that other people would love to have, things we take for granted... I don't know, I try to be happy for the little things..
And remember, wiggle your toes, because you can.

I hate the word babe.
Idk it makes me feel like the man is talking down to me.
When I hear babe I think of baby and they think I'm innocent and weak.
That makes me upset and makes me want to kick some dush in the shin.
So yeah, here is my small rant to you about the word babe.
Idk if it's just me, but I love being called darling.
Or just my name, don't call me beautiful or gorgeous, I just don't like it.

Baby, don't yell
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Mayday situation overload
Dare me to jump off of this Jersey bridge

Should I trust my heart or my head?

Okay so I'm taking online drivers ed right now and right now all they are saying is,"Don't be an idiot, watch out for idiots. If an idiot doesn't see you stop or slow down, speed up to avoid a crash . If an idiot doesn't know you have the right away, don't get mad, just slow down and let him past. We know that person was an idiot. "

Alright! Today's lyrics are:


Fail safe trigger lock down
Call wipe the dry clean slate
Quick sound the alarm
No escape from the truth
And the weight of it all
I am caught in the web of a lie

And the bitch of it all
Is that I'm running from
The desire of the people
To whom I belong

At the end of the day
You can tell me I'm wrong
'Cause you went to all of this trouble

Whoever gets it correct first gets a shoutout!

Plot twist: Only quotev users survive the apocalypse because we were too lazy to go outside to see what was going on.

Second plot twist: We don’t realize everyone else is gone until we run out of food. We don’t really care until all the Nutella is gone.

Third plot twist: We finally all meet up because we have to repopulate the world.

Forth plot twist: Everyone on quotev actually gets laid.

Time for round five
REMEMBER: You are commenting your LEAST favorite out of the choices
You can only comment ONE band a round
Just because someone picks your favorite band, doesn't mean they hate it.

OH GOD
I DONT THINK I TOLD YOU GUYS WHAT HAPPENED ON FRIDAY IN MATH CLASS
SO YESTERDAY IN MATH....
My math teacher was wearing those sketchers shape up shoes. And the kids asked if he had trouble walking. He said,"No, I was in band. The marching helped my walking."
So, I am the only kid in band in that class. So they asked me if I wore those shoes...
Me: Oh hell no.
Teacher: She's not in band... She's those flag people (aka color guard)
Me: For your information, I am in the concert band, I just don't do marching
Class: OOOOOOOH
Teacher: Yeah? That means you can't walk and play an instrument.
Class: *slightly louder* OOOOOOOOOH
Teacher: Ha, Finally got her back for all the comments she said about me. (Yes he actually said this)
Me: Actually, I can march, I was in middle school marching band
Class: *even louder* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH

So today at school we had an assembly. And this guy in a wheel chair came in and told us the story on how he became paralyzed. He was 21 and he was drinking while driving.
Now, he had a friend in the car with him and his friend died. He didn't know until six weeks later, when he could actually move and speak again. He was crushed. Then he told us how his girlfriend broke up with him in the hospital. He was depressed, suicidal, but he made it through. He promised to keep living and to make the most out of his life.
He told us that whenever you feel down or upset... Wiggle your toes. You can walk, talk, you're healthy. Don't take this for granted.
You have fresh food, water, a roof over your head. Just realize what you have and be thankful for it.
He told us to stay strong and to stay positive. Killing yourself or cutting yourself isn't the answer. And you can make it through anything.

I know not a lot people know or care for 30 seconds to mars

But they just mean everything to me. They are the band that made me start to listen to of mice & men, sleeping with sirens, even my chemical romance and damn

Hearing jared Letos voice after a couple months. It's beautiful like damn

Okay okay okay
So I finished Season Seven from Dexter. You know... the show about the serial killer. And like..DAMN THAT WAS INTENSE. But anyway... I can't stop thinking about it and I have to do homework and that shit. So I decide to turn on some music to ease my mind because I'm so panic Dexter is going to die. I DONT KNOW. (Please dont spoil anything. I have watched the whole show without any) So why not music? BECAUSE
Damn it. I turned on the song Acid Rain by Avenged Sevenfold and damn it... It reminds me of Dexter...

The people who give me this wonderful thing are happy when I buy their stuff. I can't get enough. I can't ever get enough... Soon I have to try new things and find more things that make me happy. Music is my drug. And I have to have it everyday. It is the only thing keeping safe in reality.. Yet far away from insanity.

So I'm going to be honest here since barely anyone is on..
For the past four days I've basically been starving myself.
I say basically because I still eat a little bit of dinner so my parents don't suspect anything...
Anyway, at 7th period today this dushbag named josh comes up to me shoves something he made in biology that he has been showing everyone the whole day. And I say I don't care. So he replies," oh! That reply works with saying how many people care about you. No one." And walks away. So here I am, hungry, exhausted, upset and I'm on my period. And I'm just about to cry in the middle of class because he tells me that shit so often I hate it.. Then Cj, the kid I sit next to notices that I look sad and he asks me what's wrong. I just reply," dushbags." And he said ," ah, okay." And he gave me some pretzels and smiled at me. Idk, that just really made my day.. Then later I got my new Cd and I went to soup plantation and stuffed myself full.
There is a lesson to be learned from this. Think about

I love how the band teacher over here expects us to dedicate our lives for band.
Him: if there is ever a Yankees game that you got really good tickets for or whatever on a day we have to go to a football game, you still have to come because I won't take that as an answer.

No no no. Martone. If we spend money on an event, we are going to go to it. We don't plan our life around band.
Yeah mr. Martone has been weird lately... He wasn't as strict last year. It's making me want to leave band

And so at the signing... None of my friends wanted to go so I had to go by myself..
So when I got there, I looked around, saw a kid with a BMTH shirt and a kid with a SWS shirt.
I went up to them and said,"You have cool band shirts. Im going to talk to you guys. "
Them: Okay cool, What's your name.

And POOF friendship.
Then my sister texted me: How's it going?
so I replied: I AM WITH MY PEOPLE!!!!

Today lyrics are:
And after all of all my dreaming being only you,
You're standing there, baby, oh,
The things that I could do!
Back to the wall with a drink in my hand!
Back it up, baby, ride, ride, ride!

One step too late
And I never told you (never told you)
That I can't take
Another disappointment.
Breathing and gasping all leads to another messy ending.
Breathing and gasping all leads to another messy ending.

Whoever gets it right first gets a shout out!

The lyrics for today are:

And in this moment we can't close the lids on burning eyes
Our memories blanket us with friends we know like fallout vapors
Steel corpses stretch out towards an ending sun, scorched and black
It reaches in and tears your flesh apart
As ice cold hands rip into your heart

That's if you've still got one that's left inside that cave you call a chest
And after seeing what we saw, can we still reclaim our innocence
And if the world needs something better, let's give them one more reason now

Whoever get's it correct first get's a shoutout!

So in math today we got to work together but being the anti social person I am I decided to work alone and a bunch of football players were sitting next to me and being loud. So the math teacher stood behind them and said," you guys are noisy, but the band kids are the ones you have to watch." And he looked at me. And the girl in front of me looked at me and said ," but she's so innocent!!"

And at the time I was listening to king for a day and thinking ," you don't even know".

They lyrics for today are:

One by one we bite the dust
Kick the bucket and begin to rust
Give up the ghost when your number's up
We all fall down

Ashes to ashes, bones to paste
You whither away in your resting place
Eternity in a wooden case
We all fall down

The lyrics for today are...


No need to hear your voice
Or see your face
To know that you are with me
No need to kiss your lips
Or hold your hand
To know that you can feel me
I know that you can feel me

When I look to the stars
I know just where you are
You're looking down upon me
(You're looking down upon me)
When I look to the stars
I know just where you are
You're looking down upon me
(You're looking down upon me)

The lyrics for today are:
And not to mention, the constable, and his proposition, for that "virgin"
Yes, the one the lawyer met with on "strictly business"
as he said to the Mrs. Well, only hours before,
after he had left, she was fixing her face in a compact.
There was a terrible crash
Between her and the badge
She spilled her purse and her bag, and held a "purse" of a different kind.

Along with the people inside
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

At one time or another, our favorite YouTubers are going to leave us.
No more "AUDIENCE-" or "ROLE THE CLIP, STEVEN!" from Toby.
No more "Hello Internet" from Dan.
No more "SHUT UP!" from Smosh.
No more "May the odds be ever in your favor! Goodbye!" from Joey.
No more of Connor saying "Frantastic," Ricky saying "Ratchet" or being Ricky Minaj, no more JC and Wishbone. Trevor will stop doing singing videos. Tyler will stop doing travel videos. Felix will stop making his gaming videos and saying "How's it going bros?" Cry's sexy voice won't ever be heard again. Ken's saying "Stay toasty, my friends," will stop being said...

Okay! Here is the lyrics for today

Not long ago you'd find the answers were so crystal clear
Within a day you find yourself livin' in constant fear
Can you look at yourself now?
Can you look at yourself?!
You can't win this fight

And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb and
Our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside
We all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight

Whoever names the song first gets a shout out!

Here is the lyrics for today:
No matter how many deaths that I die I will never forget
No matter how many lives that I live, I will never regret
There is a fire inside of this heart
And a riot about to explode into flames
Where is your God? Where is your God? Where is your God?

Do you really want...
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead,
Or alive to torture for my sins?

Do you really want...
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead,
Or alive to live a lie?

You know... One Direction isn't the only group of people like this.
What about all the bands I and other people listen too
Watch this:
You call them satanic
You call them freaks
You call them untalented
You call them Drug addicts

But have YOU ever realized that they are not just band members?
You haters don't see the point of these band members
All you see is the tattoos, not the background. All you hear is the screaming, not the lyrics. All you feel towards these people are hate and dislike.

But none of you realize... That these people have saved more lives then you ever will
Including mine.
So how about we all shut up about this? Mmkay? Let's try and stop the hate.

I remember the end of the last summer... I had like 20 followers, I was working on my second story and I spent most of my time on an amazing kingdom hearts group.. Now I have over 800 followers working on multiple stories and posting things about bands all day. I have to say that this was a pretty good summer! And it's all thanks to you guys. <3 Thank you for making my summer worth while. And I wish you the best in school this year (Whenever you start or if you are already back in school)

I won't be on as much, bleh school. But I will try to be on when I can without getting grounded! I vow I will not get grounded this year!

Well anyway, stay in drugs, don't do school.
Stay strong, don't like the assholes win.

Why do my parents do this?
Alright, school is starting tomorrow for me and my mom comes in and tells me ,"You're not allowed to have your Ipod or your laptop in your room during school night! You have to stay out in the loud family room. You can have it in your room during weekends, but only till 6pm. "

So yeah I'm not going to be on as much. It's not that I'm really upset... I'm just...rereading what she said in my mind and it just sounds kinda stupid XD
Anyway, have a great night everyone XD

LALALALALALALALALALALALALALA I DIDN'T JUST READ THAT LALALALALALALALALA
IF ONE DIRECTION SPLITS UP I S2G I WILL CUT AND STARVE MYSELF

Someone just posted that... I won't say who. But wow just wow... That's just, sad.
Thank you for being so selfish. And Putting the fandom to shame.
If and when they do break up...True fans will keep on loving them. Not cut themselves and whine in a corner. It may be upsetting, but a true fan will accept it and move on.

To the Directioners who cut themselves, because of the engagement of Zerrie:

You are a seriously selfish person! You are so self centered that you cut yourself, hoping Zerrie will break off the engagement.... Bitch, NO! You will FOREVER have those scares on your arm. You will FOREVER have scars, constantly reminding you of the stupid reason why you made them! You will bitch and rant, about how happy Zayn and Perrie are. You will throw a tantrum when you hear about how beautiful and spectacular their wedding was! You will cry when you realize how happy they will be, and how sad you will be knowing your self harming did not cause them to break up!

What the hell!? Is this like cut for beiber all over again? This is just pathetic!! My god people!! Just let the man be happy!! Is you or anyone you know is doing this. Stop them now, please. This is one of the reasons people hate on the 1d Fandom or calls them crazy. Hope you're happy people!

Hello all you beautiful souls!
I was wondering if you guys could help me with something.. I have this story I published called https://www.quotev.com/story/2768796/Story-spoofs/
And what I do is basically spoof some of the really iffy stories on here.
So, if YOU ever find a story with bad grammar or an iffy plot, Come send it my way and just leave me a comment!
I'll give you a shout out and mention you at the end of the story!

If you had sex with one of those weird creatures that can turn into a pokemon and a human.... Would that be bestiality? I mean...If they were born a pokemon then turned into a human... Would they still be a pokemon? I would say yes.

So me, my dad and my two other sisters were on our way home. And the conversation of pokemon came up:
Michelle: Dad, you should play pokemon!
Melanie: Yeah! We'll set up a game for you!
Dad: Maybe.
Me: That means no.
Dad: Actually, maybe means maybe.
me: Come on dad. It's so obvious that it's a no
Dad: Really, it's a maybe
me: One out of three... would disagree.

To a random girl who put this on their about me: I like every genre of music except for country and screamo... but i make an exception with Linkin Park

Guuuuurl!! Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something very important indeed.
Linkin park is not screamo. They are not even close to being screamo. It is alternative rock. Mkay? I doubt you even know what that is. So just say you like Linkin park...Please.

Hey dad look at me
Think back and talk to me
Did I grow up according to plan?
And do you think I'm wasting my time doing things I wanna do?
But it hurts when you disapprove all along

And now I try hard to make it
I just wanna make you proud
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
Can't pretend that
I'm alright
And you can't change me

It was my greatest triumph... and I never looked back. You think I was afraid fleeing Brennenburg? Quite the contrary. I knew it was my purgatory - hellfire made to wash away my sins. There's no denying the things I've done. But I have paid my tribute. I gave them that awful man... I did the right thing.

This is the final Journal entry.

I wish I could ask you how much you remember. I don't know if there will be anything left after I consume this drink. Don't be afraid Daniel. I can't tell you why, but know this. I choose to forget. Try to find comfort and strength in that fact. There is a purpose. You are my final effort to put things right. God willing, the name Alexander of Brennenburg still invokes bitter anger in you. If not, this will sound horrible. Go to the Inner Sanctum, find Alexander and kill him. His body is old and weak, and yours, young and strong. He will be no match for you. One last thing, a shadow is following you. It's a living nightmare, breaking down reality. I have tried everything and there is no way to fight back. You need to escape it as long as you can. Redeem us both Daniel. Descend into the darkness where Alexander waits and murder him.

Your former self,

Daniel

It’s not fair! I’m not to blame. I’ve been manipulated by that demon. He played my guilty conscience and duped me into facing the shadow alone. That vile, conspiring man. He expects me to meet my death as he steals power beyond imagination?
Alexander, I will kill you for what you have done. If only the shadow had caught me in London or Algeria, I wouldn’t have to suffer this humiliation. You made me a murderer, a monster!

And now, I merely await my death. I'm too weak to press on. I can hardly stand as my knees fail me, I cannot see, as my eyes are dressed in tears. I'm as broken as the men I've tortured. If only I could wipe my fear away as we did with them.

I cannot believe what I have become. One of the girls escaped and I chased after her all the way upstairs. I hunted her down and...
What is a life worth? How many lives can I take before I surrender my own? Sure, I would kill a murderer to save an innocent. But to kill an innocent to save myself – a cold blooded murderer!

18th of August 1839 – The Kidnapping
Tonight, we will unlock the power of the Orb and ultimately banish the shadow hunting me. I feel it closing in on me and I fear for my life more than ever.
Just outside Altsdadt lies a small settlement where Zimmerman, a dairy farmer, lives with his wife and three children. We took the coach and went there. Our visit was unexpected and Alexander was able to strike Herr Zimmerman down without alerting the others. As he went to take care of the farm hands, I began to look for the children.

We should have more than enough prisoners to finish the ritual now.

15th of August 1839 – The Sacrifice
The blood wards are failing. The shadow beckons and its cry disarms my actions. Hurry, no time to spare. You have to kill another. Alexander produces a knife. He wants me to cut the flesh. Do it, save yourself. He is a murderer, Daniel. He is evil – a cold blooded killer. Hurry.
“Alexander, you must let me be. I have to concentrate.” Paint the man, cut the lines, cut the flesh, watch the blood spill – let it come.

“Please, I didn’t do anything.” Paint the man, cut the lines. Paint the man, cut the lines! “Please!” the man cries. Hush, hush – now you sleep.

I did well! One life for another. You hear me, Guardian of the Orb? I did all this for you! Now, once more, withdraw your shadow from my domain!

Alexander, there isn’t much time. I can feel it. We must act swiftly. I will do whatever it takes.

Banishment ritual is taking longer than expected and we have to do what is needed. I spend my time helping out with the prisoners. Being around these degenerates makes me ill. None of them even tries to face their punishment with any kind of dignity. They taunt me with their lies of innocence and their cowardly pleas of mercy. What can make a man fall so far from the grace of a civilized existence. They are all wicked men and I remind myself of it constantly. Still, I am thankful for God sending these monsters our way, as they will serve as the instruments of my salvation. I try to study the different tools in the torture chamber and learn how to use them effectively. Last time was messy and the effect suffered from my inexperience. When the next warding is to be performed, I shall be ready.

I can't stop sweating and shaking. The warding ritual was not something of a sane mind! I did not even realize the dungeon was still in use. Alexander had his servants bring one of the prisoners, a murderer, he told me. Alexander made all of the arrangements but he said I had to perform the ritual in order to have the right effect. The Shadow could be led astray by the blood of another. Killing the man would provide us precious time. What else could I do? Alexander said it had to be done. He is saving my life, I don't have the luxury of argument.

It is still early and Alexander is busy preparing for the ritual later today. Seeing him this worked up makes me question, why? What does he stand to gain? I realize he is curious about it all, but surely there must be more. Is he so foolish he will attempt to tame the power of the Orb?
I must admit that yesterday when Alexander flooded the Inner Sanctum with blue light, I realized we had but grazed the Orb's true potential. This might turn out to be more than escaping a creeping shadow. It might be the beginning of something truly extraordinary.

I could never be certain until today that I was on the right path. Using my Orb, Alexander managed to channel its powers unto us. The Inner Sanctum flared with blue fiery light and I could feel the same things I felt in the dark chamber in Algeria. It was like standing in a mad whirlpool of impressions. It was terrifying, but Alexander kept calm and wielded strange tools of science in order to tame the storm.
Suddenly the blue light was stained by strains of red and the walls burst with pulsating tissue resonating with the scene. Alexander quickly covered the Orb in some cloth and the unspeakable thing vanished. Apparently, the Orb's shadow is closer than Alexander thought. He says I should prepare for a warding ritual tomorrow. I'm not sure what he expects, but I have a bad feeling about this.

Cold as ice on the darkest December
Spark a flame from a small burning ember
Trapped inside of this prison made of mirrors

As I wait for that spark to ignite me
Try to break through these walls that surround me
I'm trapped inside of this prison made of mirrors

I look to the sky
But my walls keep building higher
I'm surrounded by creations,I
Need to feel alive

I look to the sky
But the answers all around me
Oh I don't know why I have to try
To take hold of my life

There is no denying that Alexander puts a lot of faith into what I can only describe as magic. I'm not surprised, even while traveling across Europe I assumed I would have to embrace the supernatural to save my mind and life. As a novice I do everything in my power to stay focused and not dwell too much on my own doubts.
Alexander woke me up early and told me it was time we got started on our work. He was obviously excited to get going and we headed downstairs to the old dungeon where he preferred to attempt his rituals.

It turns out that Alexander is a true Renaissance man, paralleled only by Da Vinci, I'm sure. He showed me several rooms fitted for specific research such as anatomy studies, alchemy and botany. The crown of Brennenburg must be the Inner Sanctum, a most hallowed ground, where we shall attempt to permanently banish the orb's shadow.

4th August 1839
The nightmares woke me up in the early morning and for a moment I forgot where I was. Shortly after there was a knock on my door. Alexander had heard my screams and asked me to join him in the parlor.
As we drank our tea, Alexander began to tell me what he knew. It seems like the orb I found casts a long and dark shadow. It is not only a powerful item, but a dangerous one. Simply by touching it you invoke the powers within and if you are too weak to control it, it will devour you. The shadow is a sluggish thing lagging behind the wielder, killing anyone or anything in its path to reclaim the Orb.

I said I didn't care about its powers and that I should throw it away. Alexander advised against this as I would still be a part of the path to the Orb and eventually suffer death. Having the Orb, I would at least have the chance to fight back when the time came. I asked Alexander what he meant when he said he could protect me and he answered that things can be done- but at a price.

Thrown to the floor, we were never meant to last
And all we are, are empty shells
Try to pick us up, you’re gonna cut yourself

Not knowing just how fragile we really were
Like it was the first day of the rest of our lives
Then the bricks began to fall
And we could see the cracks along the wall
We didn’t know it couldn’t go on forever

I feel like I have fled the world and all its worries. Brennenburg is a majestic creation perched upon a forest-clad hill with towers reaching well above even the highest pine trees. Following the winding road leading to the gates gives the impression of discovering something forgotten, as if journeying with Marco Polo to the hidden Xanadu.
Alexander, the baron, is a peculiar but gracious man. He seems well versed in worldly matters and is not at all as eccentric as I assumed. My room is exquisite and I am confident that no hotel for miles could even hope to match it.

As the sun sets on Brennenburg its fairy-tale varnish turns to an eerie gloom. Alexander's strange servants are never far away. They are a quiet lot and their behavior could only be described as skulking. Alexander seems pleased by my presence. As he puts it, it seems like I got here just in time.

2nd August 1839
I have arrived at the village of Altstadt. It's a haven in the midst of a vast forest and it's the last stop before my final destination, Castle Brennenburg. It's late in the evening and the outrider, who has been with the coach since Bremen, advised me to wait until morning before I venture further.
I have arranged for a bed at Der Mühle, the village's only inn, and am now waiting for the sun to rise. I try to sleep, but as I close my eyes I see the men who fell victim in London. My fear and shame forces me to witness the same scenes over and over.

They are dead because of me.

How has this escaped me? They're all dead. Limbs scattered, heads split down the middle, their skin flayed as if boiled. I feel like I'm falling into myself. What's happening? Sir William Smith, professor Taylor and now doctor Tate. Is it following me? How can it not be? It's the damned thing I brought from Africa. Something is after me.
I have no choice but to trust the baron. He better know what he claims. If he is wrong, I suspect he'll regret it as well.

Tucs have more of a buttery taste.. and also it's bigger then a ritz
While a Ritz has the more bland salty taste
And out of the two I have to say Tucs are better

14th July 1839- Part two
What am I to make of this? Protect me from what? Is someone after me? I looked up Brennenburg and traced it to the Prussian woods near the Baltic Sea. While being the least informative letter I've received, it causes me greatest distress and interest.

As I write my thoughts are drawn to my nightmares in which a most disturbing sound calls to me. A sound defying description, a voice from the void. The last few weeks have been awful with so many sleepless nights dreading a repeat of those horrid dreams. Tomorrow I shall visit my physician, doctor Tate, in hope that he can provide me with sedatives to help me sleep.

I've read every book I can find on the subject. While rich in legend and hearsay, my knowledge is lack for the insight I crave. I've sent letters to many in Herbert's address book, and received answers of varying importance.
Today I got one which differed greatly from the others--- from a baron in Prussia. He said nothing about the quaint stories of priests in underground temples. He didn't even mention them. He simply wrote:

"I know. I can protect you. Come to Brennenburg castle." Signed Alexander

5th July 1839
Today I went to the university looking for answers. I was able to sneak into Herbert's office and pick up an address book along with some relevant text books.
Professor Taylor at the faculty of history was very helpful and I managed to approach the subject of the orbs. The most interesting aspect was the prevalent trace they had left in our culture. The mythic orbs may in fact have inspired the Globus Cruciger which so many royal regalia holds to this day. In ancient times the orbs were held by priests as a symbol of the sun and its power.

As I was leaving I overheard a disturbing conversation. Sir William Smith, the geologist, was killed last night. Less than a fortnight had passed since I'd asked for his expertise. I know it's silly, but I can't help feeling responsible somehow.

It's done! The orb is assembled. I was awakened by an exhausting nightmare. Shaking and sweating, I retired to the drawing room with a cup of tea. The relic pieces lay spread across the table as I'd left them. But somehow, I knew how it was supposed to be. I fetched the tar, which I had prepared to fix the pieces together, and without fault, I joined them, producing the orb I remembered so clearly. The tar proved unnecessary. It was pushed out from the joining pieces as they merged on their own with no adhesive.
The ancient stone relic now rests on my table. Its immaculate surface and perfect shape could have been molded by a factory. This is all too strange.

3rd of July 1839 -Part two
I continued reading the peculiar text. Herbert states his facts without judgement or passion, but suddenly I could read frustration into his text. He pushed his men to investigate the underground tomb, an effort which seems to have strained the minds of his men. Madness spread through the ranks, and Herbert had to take some extreme measures to continue. He finally visits the chamber himself, where he retrieves the orb to the surface.

His account confuses me greatly. If he has the orb, what are those pieces in my drawing room?

Today I picked up Herbert's things at the custom's house. I dug through the trove of documents he had carried and found a log detailing the expedition. The nature of this text ranged from quick notes to colourful accounts of transpired events. I skimmed the pages, trying to figure out what might have happened.
May 17th, the day I was trapped inside the orb chamber, Herbert dryly states:

"Recovered Daniel after one hour of entrapment."

This confused me greatly. I was suffocating within minutes. How could I have lasted an hour?

I received a letter today from the Algerian governor's office disclosing the fate of Herbert's expedition. About a week after my departure, Abdullah, one of the men traveling with us, returned from the desert. He was badly injured, as if maimed by a lion. The man rambled deliriously about the expedition being attacked by something horrible.
The French quickly dispatched a search party to look for the expedition. After searching for days, they found the camp abandoned without any trace of Herbert or his men. Tomorrow I'll retrieve the things they recovered from Herbert's tent at the customs house. I don't know what to make of it, but I'm worried for him.

I feel the need to continue this journal, even though it was intended for my journey in Africa. This must be something very important, I just know it. I've taken it upon myself to piece the orb back together, but it's been more difficult than one might think. The pieces are behaving strangely. They seem to change color, shape and texture, but ever so slightly.
Yesterday I took careful measurements and notated any significant markings. Today, I confirmed my suspicions. They were changing. I was terrified and rushed off to see the finest geologist in London, Sir William Smith. I approached the subject with care, and we discussed how rocks change form. He told me about the nature of glass, how it eventually collapses on itself, like ice slowly melting over the course of centuries.

Smith eased my mind a bit, but I can't escape the feeling that these shards have otherworldly properties.

You know what they do to guys like us in prison.

You helped us kill all our friends.

You welcomed us to The Black Parade.

You told us that someone out there loves us after all.

So in return...

We thank you for the venom.

22nd of June 1839
It's been more than a month since my last entry. After the event inside the underground chamber in Algeria, professor Herbert insisted I return to England. He said he didn't want to risk forfeiting the entire expedition lest I took a turn for the worse. An excessive decision in retrospect, but I'm glad it turned out that way.
I found my journal this morning in the haphazard collection of things brought home from Africa. Next to it lay the broken stone orb wrapped in cloth. I tried to assemble it, but I couldn't. The pieces wouldn't fit together, as if they weren't from the same object. Could I have imagined it all? Was there ever a complete orb?

Paint the man, cut the lines, cut the flesh, watch the blood spill – let it come.
“Please, I didn’t do anything!" The man cries. Meh meh meh! Paint the man, cut the lines. Paint the man, cut the lines! “Please!” the man cries. Hush, hush – now you sleep.

17th of May 1839 - Inside Chamber
After pounding the unforgiving stone wall for what seemed like an eternity, I realized it was hopeless. I was trapped. I fell to the ground gasping for air, trying to focus. That's when I saw a faint blue shimmer.
My weakened body was heavy to carry, but I managed to push myself towards the enchanting light. It was waiting for me. Enclosed in dark nothingness, I felt myself drawn to the mystic light. I reached out closing it in my hands.

The faint glow escaped my fingers and began to spark brightly and spirit me away. Unlocking alien memories of spiraling towers, endless deserts, and impossible geometry.

The next thing I can remember is the grating sound of stone being lifted. The voices of the Arabs pulling me to safety. And grasped firmly in my hands was the broken pieces of a most peculiar relic.

My hands tremble as I write. I feel a need to document my tribulation for I fear that my memory will fail me if I linger.
Today I took some men and ventured into the dark ancient passage we uncovered. Our torches burned faintly in the murky air as we slowly made our way underground. The men were superstitious and fearful. They argued loudly and I felt their strange language getting to me. I mustered my strength and yelled at them to continue down the slopes and broken steps.

17th of May 1839 - continue
The crudely carved passage confused me. It looked much older than the 4th century structure we had expected. The twisting path emerged into a great ante-chamber. The walls were lined with statues unlike any I'd ever seen. Despite their unearthly quality I felt a strange familiarity toward them, which haunts me still. At the far end of the chamber, a great slab of stone sealed off whatever lay ahead. I gave the order to raise it, and as I pushed through the narrow space, the heavy stone suddently dropped, sealing me inside.

I was trapped.

6th of May 1839
The unflinching African sun has continued to plague our expedition, making it impossible to dig until dusk. How Professor Herbert managed to find the location in these vast plains of nothingness remains a mystery to me. When I asked him about the tomb again, he told me about the legend of Tin Hinan, "the mother of us all". An interesting story in its own right, but I can't help feeling there's more. Later that evening, we uncovered a passage beneath the dunes leading to a sand-covered stone structure. The professor was confident it was the tomb we sought and ordered the others to clear the way-- late into the dark cold night. Tomorrow, I shall lead the men into the ancient structure, hoping to reach the burial chamber. No matter what the professor is keeping from me, the dig should yield something interesting to take back to London and the British Museum.

Should I feel anything...? Should I even bother....That woman...that bloody woman....She won't shut up! I walked...Away from Brennenburg, never to look back, never to repeat my past! Why won't she shut up about my past! I don't want to remember the screams...the blood....that little girl in the dirty blue dress.... I was too...Insane to realize what I did to that girl.... she almost escaped! I couldn't let that happen! I found that bloody girl....she was so small...so innocent....she was absolutely....terrified... I did what I had to do... I went up to her and I killed that little girl...I thought I was keeping the world clean.... by getting rid of those....those....'Criminals'...But I was wrong....so very wrong... Killing that girl... It destroyed my psyche...though Alexander fooled me...I knew for a bloody fact that girl was innocent.. I was disgusted with myself... I should stop talking to myself... people might think I am insane...

It was my greatest triumph...and I never looked back. You think I was afraid fleeing Brennenburg? Quite the contrary. I knew it was my purgatory - hellfire made to wash away my sins. There's no denying the things I've done. But I have paid my tribute. I gave them that awful man...I did the right thing.

Hey all you beautiful souls! This is the first story I ever posted on here, and I have to say, I wasn't too impressed! But now I am rewriting it and so far I have the first five chapters done! If you could take the time and read it that would really make my day. I just want some feedback on how I am doing with it, thank you!

Great, my Dad thinks I'm stupid and thinks I need extra help because I got a C in Algebra 2.

I don't know... I have been snapping at people more often and I get mad for no reason... Maybe I shouldn't talk to certain people for a while.. It will only make me more stressed out.

Dear Mom,
Thank you for supporting me and helping get through all the tough times with my Dad. Even though you had your moments where you left me alone, like when you didnt care when I had horrible stomachaches for months yet you did nothing. But BESIDES FROM THAT. You gave me support when my dad was screaming my face and I love you for that. You care and ACTUALLY listen to me sometimes. You dont always look at things one way. And I must thank you for that so much. Love you mom.

Dear Disney,
Thank you for filling my childhood with wonderful movies like the Lion King and Aladdin. But you really need to STAPH with the bad movies like the puppy ones, and really over half of the things on the Disney channel. Its AWFUL. Please focus on making good movies again. Like Wreck-It Ralph. That was good. Also, make a gay Prince. Please, I think it would really good and would help kids learn to not bully kids like that.

I still remember when my friends and I were talking about zombies.

Me: If zombies were real, who do you think would die first?
Friend: The people who love one direction
Other friend: I thought they were already zombies.
Friend: They turn you into a zombie by blasting it until you like it.
Me: what does make the Justin Beiber fans?
Other friend: Those fast zombies, the ones that are rare. Because they are slowly getting killed by the one direction Zombies.
Me: ...What if they like both.
Friend: Hide girl, they are the most horrible kind.

The rally today at school was really nice, they had a slideshow for all the seniors...and the ending they showed a picture of Drew, the kid who died of cancer. They showed his graduation picture and it was a really touching moment to see how much the school and the students cared about him.

Also, took my math test today...I hope I did well. I mean, if I fail I probably wont be on till june. BUT it was multiple choice and it seemed like I did well and it seemed easy...but that just makes me even more paranoid.

Is it just me, or did we used to have normal smelling shampoo before?
I remember a couple years ago when shampoo bottles said, "strawberry", "peppermint", and "citrus".

Nowadays, I pick up a bottle and it says something like, "Dew gathered by monks in the Himalayas mixed with a root of the good luck plant that grows only in an obscure village in the Amazon mixed with a dash of magical berries from Narnia to give your hair volume."

I think I am going to re-watch the first seires of Yu-gi-oh. Only the first, the rest arnt worth watching.
And I'm also going to reorganize all of my cards and buy more... all because I got an artbook from Japan. I LOVE IT

If you guys are ever feeling upset, if you ever need someone to talk too. You are always welcomed to talk to me, I promise you I will listen.

Damn it guys!! Stop calling Justin Beiber a girl! It makes me sick that you try to call him a girl! Guys, why do you hate girls so much, that you would call Cananda's greatist mistake a female.

I just remembered my story idea from the 7th grade. But then I lost the notebook I kept it in. I'm wondering if I should start typing it or not.

May those killed today rest in peace. May the shooter burn in hell for this crime. I wish the families affected by this tragedy have all the support they need. And I hope they can get by this and I wish them the best of luck.

Even though no one is on, I just want to say, I have read back on past conversations....I miss the old Luxord! Reading those conversations made me cry! The way he hugged people when they were sad, the way he talked about demmy all the time, the amazing battles all of us use to have..I miss it! And even though school starts tomorow, I want you all to know! I love you all &lt;3 you made this summer amazing. I will never forget any of you! &lt;3
